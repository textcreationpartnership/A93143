            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As for his Letters which the Author hath often inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, to diſcover to the world the interior of his ſoul (which cannot be known to others, but onely from our ſelves) know, that in moſt of theſe his humility (and that upon command) diſcloſed ſuch things onely to his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and that he onely privately whiſpered in his ear, what is now divulged abroad, that he relates to his ſpiritual Father with much tranſport and raviſhment (as who can poſſeſs ſuch a treaſure, and ſay nothing of it) the great power of the preſent Grace of God in him, much after the ſame manner, and with the ſame modeſty, as one recovered of a great ſickneſſe, (for the ſtate of Sin is a great Diſeaſe) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycingly would tell his Phyſician of the preſent good Habit, and Temper, and Health, of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: That his otherwares much evidenced Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will ſufficiently perſwade his veracity in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That they are not his Letters entire, but onely ſome pieces extracted out of them, as beſt ſuiting to the Authours purpoſe: His Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, doubtleſs, containing alſo in them the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Sins (which in his Confeſſors abſence, he was neceſſitated to preſent for ſome time onely
<pb facs="tcp:115611:4"/>by Letter) and many Complaints [of his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Defects, with conſults for a remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But it became not the ſecrecie of a Confeſſor, nor the civility of a Friend, to diſcover all theſe; ner yet the Readers benefit, to know them: Since the Perfections of our Brethren, ſet before us, do nouriſh our Humility, ſuppreſs our Pride, and invite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Imitation: But their faults divulged, advance our Self-Conceit, and breed Security: Though for this Honourable Perſon, you may preſume no great faults or blemiſhes could dwell with ſo great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, ſo many good Works, ſuch exceſſive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and his Exteriour Holy Practiſes, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teſtifie a great purity of minde.</p>
            <p>Amongſt which Practiſes, though perhaps ſome things may occur, that to ſome Readers may give offence (according to mens ſeveral Principles and Perſwaſion in Religion) yet, I thought it better (do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the buſineſs onely of a Tranſlator) to let them alone; than, by cutting them out, both to give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to thoſe who allow ſuch things, to blame the omiſſion; and to thoſe who diſallow ſuch things, to ſuſpect them to be more, or of worſe conſequence, than they are: Eſpecially, when theſe may ſerve to provoke you, whoever think your ſelves more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated, to a Pious jealouſie: Whilſt you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that if he arrived to ſo high Chriſtian Graces and Perfection, ſuppoſed by you to be darkned with ſome Errours, how much you ought ſooner to attain the ſame, as enjoying more truth; and ſo proceed to employ your ſelf, not in ſcanning and diſputing

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y dear Reader, I am in a word or two to give you notice of three things, concerning the Contents of this Book. The firſt is, that whereas truth is the principal part of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, you may be confident that it is here exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; becauſe, whatſoever you ſhall finde here, is almoſt all of it extracted out of the Originals, and the reſt out of Authentick Copies there, where things were atteſted by ſuch as were eye-witneſſes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beyond exception.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that though we often make uſe of Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> his own Letters, as witneſſes of what he was, yet ought ye not at all therefore to ſuſpect the truth of what they relate: Becauſe firſt, his eminent vertue hath rendred him moſt creditable in every thing he ſaid, though it were of himſelf; beſides, theſe his Letters are for the moſt part directed to his ſpiritual Guide, to whom he did with much confidence unboſom the things belonging to his conſcience, and gave account, as he was obliged, of each thing that paſt in the interiour of his ſoul: And God, who beſt knows to chuſe the fitteſt means to bring his ends about, having deſigned the publiſhing of this life, whereby to leave to all faithful men a patern of perfect a Chriſtian,
<pb facs="tcp:115611:6"/>did ſo diſpoſe of things, that this his Director dwelling for ſeveral years out of <hi>Paris,</hi> he was obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him by Letters with his interiour diſpoſitions, they becoming, by this means, much more perfectly diſcovered unto us, than any otherway they could. And laſtly, we are indeed uncapable of knowing any thing of a mans interiour, but by his own declaration; and that which we underſtandin Saints of this nature (which yet makes up the principal of their ſanctity) comes by no other way than their diſcovering and opening it to ſome one, and he afterwards to the publike: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> himſelf muſt have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the ſecrets of his heart, and revealed what was hidden in his ſoul, or he muſt have remained for ever lock'd up and unknown to us; although aſſuredly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus hath all of him been by himſelf manifeſted or related.</p>
            <p>The third thing is, that being willing to obey the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of our holy Father <hi>Urban</hi> the 8. dated the 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I therefore proteſt, that my intent and deſign in ſetting forth this work is, that the matter thereof ſhould be no otherwiſe underſtood, than as grounded upon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and faith of men, and not upon the Authority of H. Church; and that, by the name of Saint, which I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times attribute to Monſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> I mean onely, that he was endued with vertue far exceeding the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, and do uſe this word onely in that ſenſe that S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives it to all the faithful, and not to put him in the number of Saints canonized, which to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs onely to the Holy Sea.</p>

                  <p>As he had naturally a very good wit, piercing reach, and great judgement, ſo was he very notable and famous for his progreſs in his ſtudies; from the which, notwithſtanding he was taken at the age of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and put into an Academy (as they call their Schools of Gentile Exerciſes) at <hi>Paris;</hi> where he ſhewed himſelf moſt dextrous and accompliſh'd in all the Exerciſes there taught: but that which moſt of all pleaſed, and, as I may ſo ſay, charmed him, was the Mathematicks, which he applyed himſelf to with ſuch diligence, that he deprived himſelf of all ſorts of divertiſemenis (which youth is given to) and therein attained to ſuch proficiency, that he underſtood them perfectly, and compoſed therein ſome Books.</p>
                  <p>But the time being now come, when God was minded to go cloſer to the work he had in hand, and to diſpoſe this choice ſoul to the execution of thoſe things, which he was deſigned for, it pleaſed him ſo to order it, that a Stationer, to whom Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> often repaired to buy ſuch Books as he ſtood in need of (for ſatisfying the curioſity and ardent deſire he had of knowledge in all Sciences, ſuitable to his condition) did one day preſent to him, the famous little Book of the <hi>Imitation of Chriſt,</hi> and deſired him to read it; but he having as then, his minde taken up with other notions, made no account of it for that time. The Stationer having brought him another day ſome Books that he had need of, preſented the ſame again to him, and with ſome earneſtneſs, beſought him to be pleaſed to read it: thereupon he yielded, and read it, and was thereby ſo enlightned and touched (as before him, a great multitude of perſons of all ſorts had been) that entertaining now no other thoughts
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115611:10"/>or affections, he reſolv'd to minde ſeriouſly his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and give himſelf up to God; ſo that amongſt the great fruits and ſignal victories obtained by that book, we may well reckon for one, this work of grace and change, wrought upon Monſieur <hi>de Renty,</hi> who alſo from that time forward, had that Book in ſo great love aad eſteem, that he always carried it about him, and made uſe thereof on all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The gracious effect which the reading of this Book wrought in his ſoul, was ſo great, that it bread and enkindled in his heart, the thought and deſire to quit the world, to conſecrate himſelf entirely to the ſervice of God, and to make himſelf a Carthuſian, although he could not but ſee himſelf, to be an onely Son, the Heir of a great Eſtate, and endowed with quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and perfections, that did open to him a way to the ſplendors of the world: And as he was naturally reſolute, firm, and conſtant, ſuccoured by the Divine affiſtance (to whoſe will and pleaſure, he gave up himſelf as an abſolute Sacrifice) after he had duely examined and ordered his deſign, he put himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the execution, which paſſed in this manner:</p>
                  <p>Being one day upon <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> Bridge, with the Lady his Mother, he deſired leave to go forth of the Coach, to buy ſomething, which being granted, he ſtole preſently out of her ſight, and ſlipping with cunning and diligence from ſtreet to ſtreet, he gets out of <hi>Paris</hi> afoot, in the moneth of <hi>December,</hi> the year, 1630. and takes the way to our Lady of <hi>Ardil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers;</hi> and a few days after this eſcape, advertiſed his Father thereof by this following Letter:</p>

                        <p>I <hi>Nothing doubt, but this alteration will bring with it ſome affliction to you; the firſt motions of Paſſion being not in the power of men, and indeed nature alſo enclining us, to bemoan the loſs of what ſhe loves: But fince that there is ſomething of God in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I moſt humbly beſeech you to lay aſide all paſſion out of your ſoul, and conſider that in it which is on Gods part. Thus it is, Sir, that after I had combated two years with my ſelf, and reſiſted all the enſpirations that God had given me during that time, I was at laſt conſtrained to break off ſo long a delay in the quitting of the world avowing, that I have not ſtrength enough to undertake the working out my ſalvation, in a place, where is practiſed the contrary to what I would effect: this is too perilous a matter for afceble perſon, that hath a deſire to march on ſure ground; and therefore I have judged, that it would be more to the purpoſe, to ſtrangle the evil in the birth, than to ſtay till it become greater and I not able afterwards to maſter it: For ſo unlike are the maxims of the world, to thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt, that I cannot at all believe, a ſoul that fears to offend him, can live long in it, and eſpecially at the Court; but that ſhe ſhal ſoon be forced to abandon it, when ſhe ſhall ſee herſelf oblig'd to comply with the corruptions of the time; which would not beſeem me now to talk of, ſince for a good while ago, my deſign hath been, rather to hide and bury in oblivion its fooleries, than to recal them into my memory. I am minded therefore to unwinde my ſelf out of this Labyrinth, although I know it will be ſaid, that I might well enough enjoy the world, and and yet keep my ſelf frow its enormities. I confeſs it, but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115611:11"/>let a man conſider what comes after, a man muſt reſolve then to be the table talk of the Rabble of our Maſters of the Mode, that will give out, that one's a Bigot Peciſian, a ſour Fellow, not fit for diſcourſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, a very burthen to the world, with a thouſand ſuch like ſayings, whereof I have had already but too much experience. In effect, a pleaſant thing it would be to ſee a young man of my inclinations enter the Court, and there act the Reformado, ſhould you, Sir, but ſee it, would not you your ſelf, in good truth, be the firſt to laugh at me for my labour.</hi>

                           <hi>I therefore humbly beſeech you, to conſider what a grief it would be to a Father, to ſee his Son in the Court and great Meetings, there onely to be contemned, and ſet at nought: not but that for all this, a good Conſcience counts it a great honor to ſuffer all theſe things for Gods ſake: but I believe it will make more for your content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I retire my ſelf; for at the Court a man muſt live as at the Court; and being not able to ſerve two Maſters, I conclude with the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No, no, and they that think ſo now, will be of another minde, when they muſt give an account to God, for what is paſt; then it will be, that they will know what it is to live well or ill, but then it will be too late; and therefore leaving the dead, to bury their dead, according to the ſmall illuminations we have, let us labour to reform our life, and to do ſomething for the love of God, who hath told us ſo expreſly, and ſo often, that we muſt deny our ſelves, for ſake all and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: which thing, I believe, you would not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to gainſay.</hi>

                  <p>Thus you have the Letter he ſent to his Father, wherein we may read his Spirit, his Devotion, and the pure and ſolid Illuminations, that already ſhone in his Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>His Father extreamly afflicted at his abſence, ſends abroad every way to ſeek him; and God, who gave him this deſire, though not to take effect, would ſo have it, that he was found at <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> although in diſguiſe, having chang'd a Gold-lac'd Suit, into a poor mans habit. He was brought back thence to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Paris,</hi> who thought it not amiſs, to carry him along with him to his Caſtle or Mannor Houſe of <hi>Beny,</hi> where he was put upon exerciſes ſuitable to his birth, wherein he gave proof of ſo much vertue, ſo much wiſdom, and good conduct, that (although but nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen year old) he was choſen by the Ballywick of <hi>Vire,</hi> to be a Member of the States of <hi>Normandy,</hi> then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at <hi>Roan,</hi> (Monſieur de <hi>Languevill</hi> being Preſident) where he ſpake ſo pertinently and prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to buſineſs, that the three Eſtates remained not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied therewith, but even alſo aſtoniſhed.</p>
                  <p>After theſe exerciſes of Nobility, he employed himſelf in the rebuilding of the Church of <hi>Beny,</hi> in ſuch ſort as we ſee it at this day; and being far from ſuch divertiſements as are uſed by Nobles of his age and condition, he roſe ordinarily at four a clock, and then went ſoftly (without waking the Groom of his Chamber) into his Cloſet, to ſay his prayers; and from thence at five a clock to the Church, and to his building, whence he return'd not till about ſeven or eight a clock at night, cauſing ſome meat to be brought him thither, and continually buſied with the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115611:13"/>workmen. We cannot doubt, but that ſuch an act of a perſon of his quality and age, and with ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, was moſt acceptable to God, and acquir'd many great graces; ſeeing (in order to ſuch) one heroick action doth more prepare a ſoul, and render it more capable, than a great number of ſmall and common ones.</p>

                  <p>ALthough the eſtate of a Religious Life (as faith teacheth, and the Church hath defin'd) is much more perfect than that of Marriage; yet as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a man, conſiſts not in the eſtate he hath choſen, but in doing preciſely and eminently the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, in what condition ſoever his providence hath placed him: God, that he might not altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> of the glory and merit of a Religious Life, inſpir'd him with the will, deſign and endeavours thereto; but yet having reſolv'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound him to all married perſons within the Church, as a perfect and compleat pattern of all vertues, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the eſtate of Wedlock, it pleaſed him to call him to that condition, of which, he ſaid, he had ſo much of aſſurance, that he nothing doubted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>At the age of 22 years, he eſpouſed <hi>Elizabeth de
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115611:13"/>Balſac</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Entragues,</hi> daughter of Mon<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>de Dunes</hi> Count of <hi>Gravilie,</hi> a Lady of great vertue, whoſe modeſty hinders me to ſpeak more of her, and will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me through the whole courſe of this Hiſtory, from giving her, before men, part of that glory, which ſhe hath deſerved in many of the good works of her husband, hereby reſerving for her, the greater glorybefore God.</p>
                  <p>Such Marriages as are made in the fear of God, and reverence of the Sacrament, are always watered from Heaven with Spiritual Benedictions, and uſually with Temporal alſo; among which as children are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the principal, ſo was their marriage bleſſed with five, of which four that remain alive (two Sons, and two Daughters) make us hope that they will ſhew themſelves according to their capacities, worthy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors, much more of the vertues of their Father, than of his wealth and poſſeſſions.</p>
                  <p>In this eſtate he liv'd, till the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age, with the modeſty, wiſdom and conduct, found in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſons of his quality and condition of life, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying himſelf in pious and laudable exerciſes, and making of viſits abroad, ſo far as Civility and Decorum required of him; wherein, his great prudence, amiable ſweetneſs, rare modeſty, mingled with well-beſitting gayery and lightſomeneſs, with gentile and very witty paſſages of diſcourſe, rendred him very acceptable, yea, and made him to be look'd upon, lov'd, and careſſed by the lare King <hi>Lewis</hi> the juſt, even to the raiſing up againſt him the envy of ſome, who, after the narrowly prying into him, could finde nothing to object, ſave onely that he was young. But he ever preferr'd before all things, the glory of God, and his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115611:14"/>own ſalvation, avoiding with great care, all occaſions of ſin, and heedfully ſhunning thoſe Rocks, whereon thoſe of his condition and age do uſually ſplit and miſcarry, ſaying the office of our Lady, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that of the Dead, with other Vocal Prayers, and performing all other things requiſite for his Salvation, which is indeed the buſineſs, for which God made us, and keeps us here on earth, and notwithſtanding all this, which the greateſt part of men, have leaſt in their thoughts.</p>
                  <p>As by his birth, he was to wear a Sword; ſo now (that Nobles and Gentlemen may behold him as a mirrour for their Inſtruction) muſt we draw him from home, and the exerciſes of Peace, and look upon him in Arms; and in that War; which (notwithſtanding all our prayers for divers years) yet ſtill continues, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we daily ſtir up and blow this fire with our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of all for his skill: Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood perfectly all the parts and functions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline of War, by reaſon of his good wit, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtudy therein, which made him admir'd in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of War, and other Meetings, and that by the moſt ancient and experienced Captains, among whom was the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> who was aſtoniſhed, that ſo young a man, with ſo little experience (as his age could allow him) ſhould be able to ſpeak ſo knowing in things of ſuch difficulty.</p>
                  <p>For his Conduct: as God had given him naturally great prudence, and (notwithſtanding all his activeneſs) a well ſettled judgement, ſo he exercis'd it very well, foreſeeing and providing for ſuch things as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. In the War of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> commanding a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115611:14"/>party of Horſe, of about Sixſcore, of whom more than ſixty were men of good birth, they arriv'd two hours within night at a Village, where they found the houſes all empty; ſo that being forc'd to quarrer each one as he could finde, Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> met happily by a ſingular providence of God over him, in his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, a poor old Woman, the onely creature left in all the Village, as not able to flie away with the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to dye with hunger and ſickneſs; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted this poor woman, and aſſiſted her in this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity both for ſoul and body; inſomuch, that being ſenſible of her obligations to him, ſhe enquired of him, whether he was of the Troops of the King, or of the Duke of <hi>Lorrains:</hi> To whom he, out of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, gave not a direct anſwer; but ask'd her, why ſhe made that queſtion? Becauſe, ſaith ſhe, if you be of the Kings party, you muſt be gone preſently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Cravats would come thither infallibly in few hours ſpace, and cut them all in pieces: This advice he communicated to the reſt of the Commanders with him, who all of them judged it fitting to horſe ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and be gone to the body of their Army. The thing proved very true, for three hours after they were gone, the Enemy came on purpoſe to charge them, which they might have done, without ſuffering one to eſcape, by reaſon of their great number, the time favourable, and themſelves freſh, ſetting upon men harraſſ'd out, and tired with the pains of a long march. Thus God watcheth over them that fear him, and for their ſakes, many others alſo: This lodging might have faln to the lot of ſome one leſs deſerving ſuch a favour from God, and that would not have made uſe of it ſo prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:115611:15"/>
                  <p>For execution of buſineſs, he was not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective therein, having a body ſtrong and robuſt, a ſpirit active, generous, and reſolute, not fearing any danger.</p>
                  <p>But for an Additament hereto, as it were the ſoul to the body, and light to beauty, we finde in him the fear of God, Piety, and Uprightneſs, without which Nobility hath but a falſe gliſter, power is deſtructive, and War brings with it miſchiefs horrible; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number. Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> all the time of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Armies, performed conſtantly his Prayers, and other Exerciſes of Devotion, when he came to his quarters, if there were a Church there: His firſt care was to viſit it, and to do his devoir to our Lord; if there were any Religious Houſe, he took up there his lodging, and (that he might not incommode them) for himſelf alone, when the Army ſtaid any time in a place, while many, and much elder than he, paſt away their time in Gaming, Drinking, Rybaldrie, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other Diſorders, he contain'd himſelf within the bounds of his uſual wiſdom, avoiding all theſe baſe and vitious actions, and entertaining himſelf in Exerciſes of Vertue and Honour.</p>
                  <p>In every place where he had any power, he wholly employed it to keep off diſorders: He forbad perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily his men the treating ill of their Hoſts that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd them, or giving them occaſion of complaint; and he never took horſe, but he made come before him, them with whom he quartered, to tell him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if any had done them wrong; and if he found that any of his, had offended, he forthwith ſaw it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, and did them right. One day being mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ready to depart, having made this enquiry of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115611:15"/>his Hoſteſs, and ſhe complaining, that one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had ſtoln a ſhirt, he cauſed them all forthwith to come before her, that ſhe might finde out the Thief; which being done, and one of them confeſſing, that he had it upon his back, he incontinently ordered, that he ſhould be ſtript of it before them all, and it reſtored to the woman, notwithſtanding many perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, thought it very harſh, and oppoſed the buſineſs: But he always kept himſelf firm to Juſtice, and ſaid, he would by no means endure any Thieves. If all that have commands, dealt in this ſort, as they ought, people would not ſtand ſo much in dread of their Souldiers, as of the moſt cruel of Enemies; and God, who is the Lord of Hoſts, would afford more bleſſing and ſucceſs to their Arms.</p>
                  <p>But as the paſſage moſt dangerous to Nobility of making Shipwrack of their Salvation, is falling out, and Duels, ſo God was pleaſed that his Servant ſhould meet with this perilous occaſion, to teach all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and thoſe that wear a Sword, how they ought to behave themſelves therein. Being in the Army, he he had a falling out with a punctilious Gentleman, which coming to the knowledge of the Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, he made it appear, that this Gentleman had no reaſon at all to be agriev'd at him; which thing they judged alſo to be very true: But the other party, not acquieſcing in this determination, appeal'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o that judgement, which according to the unhappy Maxime of the World, his Sword, could yield him, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> to Duel: who returned this anſwer to him that brought the challenge, that the Gentleman was in the wrong, and that he had given all ſatisfaction which in Juſtice he could deſire: But
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115611:16"/>this not contenting this untoward ſpirit, he perſiſted in his perilous deſign, to make him meet with his ſword; to which, finding himſelf much preſs'd, he made an anſwer, vvhich is ſo much the more conſiderable, in that he vvas ſo young, and had not as yet a reputation, but vvas to get it by Arms: The anſvver vvas this, that he vvas reſolv'd not to do it, ſince God and the King had for bidden; othervviſe, he vvould have him knovv, that all his ſatisfactions he had endeavoured to give him, came from no fear of him, but of God, and of his diſpleaſure; and that he vvould go every day after his vvonted manner, vvhither the neceſſity of his affairs call'd him; and that if he did aſſault him, he vvould make him repent it. This quarrelſome man, ſeeing he could not provoke him to an open Duel, found one day the means to meet him, and ſo to make him dravv his Svvord, vvhere, by the juſt judgement of God, this other came very ill off; for he and his ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt, and diſarm'd, got nothing for their raſhneſs, but ſhame and ſorrovv? But then this true Chriſtian Gentleman, inſtead of doing them more harm (as he might) led them to his Tent, cauſed Wine to be given them, their vvounds to be dreſt, and their Svvords to be reſtor'd them. And joyning to Charity and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, both Humility and Modeſty, as his greateſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, he kept the thing ever after in ſecret, never opening his mouth concerning it to any, as ſome vvould have done (out of vain-glory) and, vvhich is more to be vvondred at, he never aftervvards ſpake vvord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to his man, vvho vvas preſent, and ſerv'd him for a ſecond in this Aſſault; to vvhom alſo before the deed, vvhen he ſavv himſelf forced to a defence, he gave charge by no means to kill.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115611:16"/>
                  <p>This was not the onely difference, but he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo, with ſome of the Neighbours, or at leaſt good cauſe to complain of them; to which buſineſs, he brought all that Prudence, Patience, and Charity could contribute, and always came off moſt happily; and he was wont to ſay to his Domeſticks, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own differences, or theirs, that there was more of courage and generoſity to bear any injury for the love of God, than to requite it with another; and to ſuffer, than to revenge, becauſe the thing was far more difficult; that Bulls themſelves had courage enough, but that it was a brutiſh courage; whereas that of ours, ſhould be reaſonable and Chriſtian.</p>

                  <p>MOnſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> having lived to the age of 27 years, it pleaſed God to touch him now more cloſely; to enlighten him more clearly, and to call him to that high Perfection, whereunto, by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful co-operation which he yielded to this call, we have ſeen him to arrive; that like a great Torch or Luminary, he hath ſpread his beams far and wide, to <hi>Paris,</hi> and in all places where he hath been.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115611:17"/>inſomuch that he continued everie night two or three hours in prayer, and that in the greateſt rigor of winter: Every day he made two examens of his conſcience, with an exact ſearch into his ſmalleſt faults; one in the morning before dinner, and the other at even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He confeſſed twice a week, and communicated three or four times: He went one day in a week to viſit and inſtruct the poor ſick people of the great Hoſpital <hi>de Dieu.</hi> Another day, thoſe of his own Pariſh; and a third, the Priſoners; and, in the reſt, he uſed to meet at Aſſemblies of Piety.</p>
                  <p>But in regard he had more care and zeal for his Children and Domeſticks (as he was oblig'd) and well knew to diſtniguiſh Commands from Counſels, and Obligations from Voluntary Devotions, he ordered, that every evening, by the ſound of a bell, they ſhould be aſſembled, to make together their Examens, to ſay the Letanies of our Lady, and other Prayers: Every Saturday he made them, in preſence of his Lady, a Diſcourſe upon the Goſpel of the Sunday following, to imprint in them the Principles and Inſtructions of matters of their Salvation, from which, they reaped much edification and profit.</p>
                  <p>But that which was highly exemplary, was the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he kept in his journeys; which was thus, There was as much regularity therein, as in a well reformed Religious Houſe: In the morning, before ſetting out, they heard Maſs; as ſoon as in Coach, and beginning to go, the firſt thing done, was the ſaying the <hi>Itinera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> which he never omitted, how ſhort ſoever the journey was he made; next, was the ſinging of the Letanies of our Lord, then followed ſome Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; after that he ſaid a part of the Divine Office,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115611:18"/>which being done; he entertained the company with ſome good diſcourſe, and ſuch as raiſed them up ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God: Beholding the ſpacious extent of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, he would ſpeak of the immenſity of God; upon the preſenting of any beautiful object to their eyes, as any Summer-houſe for delight, any Meadow enameld with flowers, any River winding pleaſantly about the land, he would diſcourſe of the Beauty of God, or of Paradiſe, forming ſuch acts of vertue upon it, as toucht the very heart; approaching near to the place where they were to dine, he made the Examen, and being come thither (as alſo where he was to lodge at night) as ſoon as out of Coach, and before he entred the Inne, would he go to the Church, where if the door was ſhut, and no man found to open it, he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down at the door, to render his devoir to the holy Sacrament; afterward, he enquired if there were any Hoſpital in the place, to the end he might go thither, and exerciſe his Charity.</p>
                  <p>Being in his Irin, the firſt thing of all he did in his chamber, was to caſt himſelf on his knees, and to worſhip God, to pray with great affection for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that entred that place, and for pardon of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders that had been there commited: When he ſaw any thing written upon the walls or chimney, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended modeſty, he defac'd it, and in place thereof, writ words of Inſtruction in Piety, and the way to Happineſs, and endeavoured always before departure, to give ſome good advice to the ſervants of the houſe, and to ſuch poor of the place as he could meet with, that ſo by the example of our Lord, he might not paſs through any place, without doing ſome good in it.</p>
                  <p>After dinner, when up in Coach again, he made
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115611:18"/>ſome recollection, and applied himſelf to his Interior, for ſome little time; then entertained ſome recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was grave and modeſt; afterward, with the company, ſang the Veſpers; which done, he wiſht them to refreſh themſelves a little, and uſe ſome innocent divertiſement, in which, to render it Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and Holy, he interwove ſome touches of Piety: Often he cauſed them to ſing with him the Articles of our belief in French; which to that end, he had cauſed to be ſet in Muſick: About four a clock, they ſung the Compline, afterward he made by himſelf ſome mental Prayer, and being come to his Inn, his Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes were the ſame with thoſe of the morning; and this was the rule he obſerved in his journey. If that ſaying of the Jews be true, that a may man be known, in ſickneſs, at the table, in play, and in a journey, we may eaſily judge by what hath been ſaid already, how much muſt needs be the vertue of this great ſervant of God.</p>
                  <p>As the end of Marriage is to have children, and of Chriſtian Marriage to render them vertuous, in order to Eternal Happineſs; ſo he took very great care, both by himſelf and others, to make his children ſuch; and for that end, to engrave deeply in them the fear of God, to diſaffect them from the eſteem of the world, to let them know, that the Maximes of it are much contrary to the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and that true Nobility conſiſts in vertue. Behold here his thoughts of this matter, as he wrote them to a certain Lady.</p>

                     <hi>For the Education of Infants, God, having diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed their conditions, ſeems to teach us, that there

                     <hi>But if they go not thus far; yet at leaſt, do they not quite choak in the heart of a young Gentleman all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Principles? For example, you know how theſe Duels infect the mindes of our youth: Now tell me, how many are there, who would be content, that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being grown up, and challenged, ſhould refuſe to fight? and much leſs would be content, were they ſure they ſhould come off without harm, and get the better? but what will this come to at laſt, that we never make to them any diſcourſe expreſly tending to the cordemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Duels, and ſhewing the miſchievous effects of them; which yet we ought to do ſo much the oftner, and that to the bottom, inaſmuch as their inclination, the example, esteem and honour of the world, doth engage and incite them to theſe quarrels; if perhaps youth let fall any ſpark of this furious hot coal, which is naturally in us, ſome one will, it may be, in a kinde of ſmile, and by the by, Oh that's not good! God forbid ſuch a thing: yes, but take notice, I pray you, whether you uſe no more earneſtneſs than this to prevent your ſons having

                     </head>
                     <p>BEfore I ſpeak of the Vertues of this man of God in particular, I muſt ſay ſomething of them in general (as it were the Ground-work) and I have two things to ſay:</p>
                     <p>The firſt, that among all the Perſons of Piety that I have known, I have not ſeen any whoſe Vertues have been, in my opinion (all things conſidered) more ſolid, more ſtrong, and more accompliſhed, than were his. I ſpeak thus much of him, for that I have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115611:20"/>been intimately acquainted with him many years, even to his death: ſo that when I fancie and figure in my minde all the ſeverals of his carriage, both interior and exterior: I cannot but conceive him, as a moſt eminent Idea and Pattern, and look upon him, as a Model of a Perfection Conſummate; wherein, all they that have had any thing to do with him (who were not a few, by reaſon of his many employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the good of his neighbour) will eaſily accord with me, and witneſs aſſuredly, that I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too much.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, that we cannot better learn what we deſire to know of him, than from himſelf, and that by an account which he gave to his ſecond Director, a Religious of the Society of Jeſus, who ſucceeded the Reverend Father <hi>de Condrien;</hi> and who had told him, it was neceſſary for him, to know his diſpoſitions, and the courſe which he obſerved. Behold here then what the Original gives us, though ſomethings be left out, becauſe they are ſet down in the Chapter aforegoing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have delaid ſome days, after the command I had to ſet down the employing of my time, for the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of ſome things therein; but I finde nothing there of ſtrict order, or which can well be ſet down in writing, becauſe all conſiſts in a kinde of ſelf abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and following after the order of God, which cauſeth in a manner continually diverſe things, but all upon the ſame bottom</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115611:21"/>part of the night in Prayer] <hi>at my awakening, I enter upon my bottom of Self-Annihilation, before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic of God; I unite me to his Son, and Spirit, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him my homages: Being riſen, I take Holy water, I cast down my ſelf, and adore the bleſsing of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which gives us acceſs, and reconciles us to God: I deliver up my ſelf to the Holy Infant Jeſus, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his Spirit: I ſalute ſometimes my good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, St.</hi> John Baptiſt, <hi>St.</hi> Tereſa, <hi>with ſome other Saints, and afterward I recite the</hi> Angelus.</p>
                     <p>He ſaith [ſometimes] not that he fail'd out of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion or inconſtancie, being extremelie exact and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the continuance of his Exerciſes of Devotion; but out of the force of an active application, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times paſſive, that he had to God, which kept him from any other diverſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I cloath my ſelf, which is ſoon done, and after paſs to the Chappel, through a little Parlour, where over the Chimney. I have ſet an Image of the Holy Virgin, holding her Son, as the Lady of the Houſe; I kiſs the earth before her, and ſay,</hi> [Monſtra te eſſe matrem, &amp;c.] <hi>I devote my ſelf to her ſervice entirely, with the offering up of my Family, Wife, Children, Domeſticks; and I have practic'd this offering of them to her a long time, that by her means they all may be perfected for God; and riſing up, I ſay to her,</hi> Mater incomparabilis or a pro nobis.</p>

                        <hi>After that I enter into the Chappel, where I caſt my ſelf down, and adore God abaſing me before him, and making me the moſt little, moſt naked, moſt empty of my ſelf, that I can; and I hold me there by faith, having recourſe to his Son, and to his Holy Spirit, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is his pleaſure, may be done by me, and ſo I abide.

                        <hi>For the Interior therefore, I follow this Attractive, and for the Exterior, I ſee the Divine Will, which makes me to follow it, and which carrieth me to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern my ſelf according to it, with the diſcernment of his Spirit, in all ſimplicity: and ſo I poſſeſs, by his grace, in all things, a great ſilence Interior, a profound Reverence, and ſolid Peace: I confeſs me, uſually on Thurſdays, according to the order that hath been given me, and communicate almoſt every day, as perceiving my ſelf drawn thereto, as alſo to ſtand in great need of it. In a word, the Bottom which hath been ſhewed me to ſtand on, is to render my ſelf to God through Jeſus Chriſt with ſuch a purity, as hath in it operation, to worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, after a manner altogether ſtript and naked, and of loving him with all my heart, with all my ſoul, and with all my power, and of ſeeing in all things, and adoring the conduct of God, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it.

                     <p>Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> followed exactly this conduct, and therein made a great progreſs, which he went on in perfecting to his death, with marvellous improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo that as the laſt touches which the Painter gives to his Picture, are far different from thoſe of the firſt rude draughts; or, as the Sun hath more of heat and light, as he advanceth higher in his carreer, and approacheth to Mid-day, than when he but newlie riſeth: In like manner, the applications, the ties, and the unions which this excellent man in his latter years had with Jeſus Chriſt, and the actions which he either did for him, or received of him, were quite other from thoſe at his beginning; for he was then wholie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate

                     <p>Hence it was, that he had no other object before his eies, but Jeſus Chriſt, that he thought not but of him, that he loved nothing but him, that he ſpake not but of him, that he wrought not but for him, and alwaies after his ſampler, that he read not but the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he carried alwaies with him, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by all means poſſible to engrave the knowledge and love of it in all hearts.</p>

                        <hi>It is about a fortnight ſince theſe words were put upon my ſpirit, without any contribution on my part, or of any thing that might renew the Idea's of them,</hi> quaere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam aquarum viventium <hi>[ſeck the vein of living water] and juſt as they were expreſt to me, my ſpirit (like as when one comes up a River, to its Spring-head) was to ſeek Jeſus Chriſt from the beginning of his Pilgrimage, to the point of his Glory; when ſet down in his Throne at the right hand of his Father, whence he ſends his ſpirit to animate his Church, and enliven thoſe that are his: I ſaw that there indeed was the Source, whence the ſprings of living waters do flow to us, and that thither we were to make our addreſſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I could report here more ſuch touches, with which his letters to his Director were beſprinkled: but I

                     <p>When he wrote to other perſons, he always inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething of our Lord, to excite them to binde themſelves to him, and to propoſe him to themſelves in all things, as a model of their actions.</p>
                     <p>One while he writes thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let us forget all, to think of this faith which makes alliance between God and us through Jeſus Chriſt, who is come to publiſh this truth, which he hath ſealed with his blood, and which he will conſummate in his glory, at that time when we ſhall appear to have been faithful in following his Spirit. Let us go after, and with Jeſus Christ to God, for he is our way.</hi>

                     <p>Another while thus,</p>

                        <hi>'Tis a thing admirable, that it hath pleaſed God to ſeud us his Son, to the end that we may not look on him any more as our Creator onely; but alſo through the alliance that we have with him, we may call him Father. He is therefore our Father from this time forward, and it is certain, that he conſiders us as his children in the perſon of his Son Incarnate: But the thing of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, is a firm aniting of our ſelves to this Son, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiruing that life of his upon earth; within this of ours, by the direction of his Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus alſo in another Letter,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let Jeſus Chriſt be in each of us our bond, our ſoul, our life as he is our pattern: Lets take a nearer view of this Holy Original, enter into his Principles, lay hold

                     </p>
                     <p>Writing to another, he ſpake thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I adore and bleſs with all my heart, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for that he opens you his heart, to poſſeſs wholly yours: he will make it to dye, and will reduce it to a Holy Poverty, which ſhall cauſe you to taſte the true Life, and compleat Riches, and to avow that it is a great mercy to belong to Jeſus Chriſt: I beſeech him to beſtow on you his moſt ſanctifying graces, and that we may beth dye well, and live well, by his Spirit: Let us enter into this Spirit, which will give us the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Energie of the Children of God: All other preſence and application to the Divine Majeſtie which is not by this union of the Soul to Jeſus Chriſt is onely of the creature towards the Creator, which carries indeed reſpect, but gives not the life and approaches of children towards God their Father, where being united to the Interior operations of Jeſus Christ, we finde there, the affections of true children; which we can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Let us end with that, which a perſon, to whom he unboſom'd himſelf, confidently in this matter, reports of him: This rare man, ſaid he, appeared touched with a verie tender and fervent love towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: I have obſerved, that his Converſations and Diſcourſes did ſhoot alwaies at this mark, to imprint in ſouls the knowledge and love of our Lord with true ſoliditie. In diſcourſe with him, I had often from him theſe words:</p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:115611:26"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I avow that I have no guſt in any thing, where I finde not Jeſus Chriſt; and for a ſoul that ſpeaks not of him, or in which we cannot taſte any effect of grace, flowing from his Spirit (which is the principal of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both inward and outward, that are ſolidly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) ſpeak not to me at all of ſuch a one: Could I, as I may ſo ſay, behold both miracles and wonders there, and yet not Jeſus Chriſt, nor hear any talk of him, I count all but amuſement of ſpirit, loſs of time, and a very dangerous Precipice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And at ſeveral other times he ſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let us love Jeſus Chriſt, let us unite our ſelves to his Spirit and Grace, miſerable ſinner, as I am, who love him not, yet ſhould I be much joy'd at leaſt, to ſee my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ſupplied by others that love him fervently; but I am too unworthy to obtain a matter ſo great, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my ſelf do bear ſo ſmall a part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seeing then this faithful ſervant and follower of Chriſt Jeſus had ſo ſtrong an application, and intimate union with his Divine Lord (as 'tis eaſie to gather from what hath been ſpoken) we cannot but aſcribe to this application and union, all his vertues, which we are going now to ſpeak of in ſeveral; and to look upon them, as effects of this cauſe, ſtreams of this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and branches of this Stem.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115611:27"/>deſtin'd by God to this glory, and quickned by this Spirit, encounters his body with rigorous Auſterities, thereby to reduce it to its duty, and hinder it from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying him in his Interior Exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>He begins therefore to faſt every day, making but one meal, which he continued divers years, until he was enjoyned otherwiſe, and to take more nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be the better able to undergo the great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours he undertook for his neighbour. Some days in the week, he wore an iron Girdle, ſet with a double rank of long prickles, and a bracelet of the ſame: on other days he diſciplin'd himſelf rigorouſly, &amp; at ſome times wore haircloath, having continually on his breaſt a braſs Crucifix, reaching to the bottom of his ſtomack, the nails whereof being very ſharp, entred into his fleſh.</p>
                  <p>When he went into the Countrey, and was come to his Inn, he would go into the Kitchin, to eat there, if it might be, among ſervants, and other mean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and that for two ends, both there to mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ifie his body, and to ſpeak ſome good thing to thoſe poor people: and when night conſtrained him to take his chamber, he diſmiſſed his ſervants, to lie in other rooms, and himſelf paſt the night in a chair, or caſt himſelf on a bed, in his cloathes, and boots, which was his cuſtom till death.</p>
                  <p>Being come to <hi>Amiens,</hi> where I was, and a Lady (one of the chief of the Town) having prepared a ſtately bed in a brave Chamber for him, in honour of his vertue and cuality, he was much troubled, and would not at all uſe it, but laid him down upon a bench, and the day after, as being much aſham'd, complained to me of the Lady for it: ſo that to enjoy the bleſſing of lodging him at her houſe, ſhe was fain
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115611:27"/>to change his chamber and bed, and to accommodate him after his own mode; that is to ſay, where he might not be ſo much at his eaſe.</p>
                  <p>His Mortification in diet was very great, eating lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and always of the worſt, as not forgetting that our miſery came not, but by eating of delicious fruit: Dining in company on a Fiſh-day, one of the gueſts that noted his actions, obſerved, that all he eat, was ſome Pears onely, and that with ſo great modeſty and recollection, that one might eaſily diſcern, that his minde was on God, and not upon his meat.</p>
                  <p>When one of his friends, a man of piety, at <hi>Caen,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him one day at dinner with ſome little cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as a perſon of quality, he ate very little, &amp; became much mortified and aſhamed, as he declared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that Chriſtians ſhould be Feaſters; adding, that a little would ſuffice, and what a torment it was to him, to be where there was ſo mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h chear, as a thing quite contrary to the poverty of Chriſt; who notwithſtanding ſhould be to us for our rule: He would tell his friends, that a little bread, a little lard and butter, was ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, his friends acquainted with this grace of Mortification in him, took no more thought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diet, knowing his beſt entertainment to be the meaneſt fare. The perfection of a Chriſtian life, and the fulfilling of Gods will, was to him (after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Lord) as moſt exquiſite and delitious meat and viands; and when any gave him opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or left him to his liberty, to practiſe this Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it pleaſed him exceedingly. Often at <hi>Paris,</hi> when ſome deed of charity had drawn him far from home, that he could not return to dinner, he would
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115611:28"/>ſtep in (all alone or unknown) to a ſmall Victualling-houſe, or ſome Bakers ſhop, and make his dinner with a piece of bread, and a draught of water, and ſo very gay and chearfull, go on with his buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>And what he pracriſed for the mortifying of his guſt, was in like manner done for his other ſenſes, the ſight, the hearing, the ſmell, and the touch. Being come to <hi>Pontois,</hi> on a very cold day in winter, and lodging at the Carmelite Nuns, he deſired earneſtly the Nun that was the Door-keeper, to have no fire made, nor bed prepared for him; and after he had diſcourſed with ſome of them, he old the laſt, that he muſt go make ſome little viſits (and that was to viſit the Priſoners, the poor that were aſhamed to beg, and to employ himſelf in ſome other deeds of charity, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgot at any time, how little ſoever was his leiſure) He returned about nine a clock at night, when the Nuns went to ſay Matins, and without taking any thing to eat, went into the Church to his prayers, which he continued till eleven a clock, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into his chamber, not ſuffering a fire to be made for him, although by his own confeſſion, the cold did incommode him very much.</p>
                  <p>He conſtantly kept a vigilant eye over himſelf in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time, place, occaſion, and even in the meaneſt things, for the mortifying of his body; daily putting it to ſome hardſhip, or at leaſt hindring it from ſenſe of pleaſure: And to that end had found out ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notable and ingenious inventions; ſo <hi>bearing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually about him the mortification of the Lord Jeſus in his body:</hi> that the life of Jeſus might live and ſhine forth in it, well knowing, as the ſame Apoſtle elſewhere ſaith, <hi>That thoſe that are Chriſts, have crucified
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115611:28"/>the fleſh, with the affections and luſt thereof:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to ſay the truth, the more a man is full of one thing, the leſs room there is for its contrary; the more one ſinks into darkneſs, the further off from light; and, as we ſaid above, there is nothing more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Spirit, than the fleſh: ſo muſt we of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity conclude, the more a man pampers his fleſh, the more doth he indiſpoſe and eſtrange himſelf from the life of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thus this illuminated perſon dealt with his body, as with his enemy, out of the deſign he had to lead a life truly ſpiritual. Whatſoever might content and flatter his ſenſes, was inſupportable to him; whence it happened, that one day, there ſlipt from him this word to a confident, that God had given him a great hatred of himſelf: and this was advanc'd ſo far by his fervent and unſatiable deſire of mortifying himſelf, that beſide the moderation that his Director was obliged to lay upon him, a famous perſon of our days, the Carmelite <hi>Nun</hi> of the Covent of <hi>Beaulne,</hi> Siſter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet of the Holy Sacrament, who lived and dyed in a fragrant odour of Sanctity, with whom he was moſt intimate in the bonds of grace, did out of divine light ſhe had in that matter, much reprehend him for it; and gave him her advice in the buſineſs, whereunto, for the confidence he had in her (and that not without good cauſe) being willing to yield, he remitted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his rigour, although not without complaint: which he teſtified to a perſon thus, in writing:</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>For all he was thus held in, he left not off the war which he made with his body, in each thing he could (but without tranſgreſſing the Orders he had received) till he thereby came to ſuch a point of perfect Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that his body became, as it were, dead, and inſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>ONe of the moſt great and admirable Vertues that ſhone in Monſieur <hi>de Renty,</hi> was this, that in the poſſeſſion of riches, he was utterly diſingaged from the love of them, and poſſeſſed in a moſt high degree (as we ſhall now declare) the firſt of the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, which pronounceth, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> of grace in this world, and of glory in the other.</p>
                     <p>A truth, which ſerved him for a powerful attractive, to endeavour the gaining of this rich treaſure: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of writing to a perſon of Pietie, he thus ſaid:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I was the other day touch'd in reading the eight Beatudes; and upon this word</hi> Beatitude <hi>I took notice, that in effect there were no other Beatitudes but theſe; for if there had, our Lord would have taught them, and therefore thoſe ought to be our whole ſtudy: But what ſhall I ſay? we ground not our ſelves upon them, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the grace to do it; but run after the Beatitudes of the world, and our own Concupiſcience, quitting that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115611:30"/>which is clear, and given us by our head Chriſt Jeſus, to be in a ſtate of hurley-burley and confuſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of trouble, danger, and unhappineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was not to theſe kinde of Beatitudes that he ran, but to thoſe of the Goſpel; and in particular to the firſt, concerning which, lets hear what one ſaith of him, a perſon very credible, and of his intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. I never ſew m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n, ſaid he, in ſo perfect a poverty of ſpirit, nor in ſo ardent a deſire to feel the effects of it, as was he: And in the fervour of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, he ſaid to me,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Procure by your prayers, that we may change this form of life, when will you labour with God, that this may be? this habit, and this wealth, is to me moſt painful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have talked ſince his death with a Father, to whom he had communicated his inclinations, to leave all; who told me, that one day he deſired of him with many tears, and on his knees, his advice in the matter; and that he was never more ſurpriz'd, than to ſee Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> at his feet, and in theſe ſentiments of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And I have heard him ſay, that the touch from God, to ſeparate him from the creatures, and to make him quit the manner of living ſuitable to his birth, was ſo powerful over his ſoul, that if another touch from the ſame hand had not kept him back at the ſame time, he had abandoned all; and according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of S. <hi>Alexis,</hi> had gone to live a poor life, as he did: but that God, that imprinted this deſire of poverty in him, did hinder the effecting of it, to keep
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115611:30"/>him in the ſtate wherein he had placed him; which was to him no ſmall croſs, becauſe the deſire torments and afflicts the ſoul in proportion to its vehemency, when it cannot arrive to the poſſeſſion of the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: But becauſe he was abſolutely conformable (as it was his duty in all things) to the will of God, he bare this croſs, as contrary as it was to his affection, with great peace, and a perfect ſubmiſſion to what God had ordered.</p>
                     <p>Another witneſs of like authority, gives him this teſtimony. He told me, ſaid he, often, in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we had together, that he was aſhamed when he entred into his houſe, to ſee himſelf ſo well lodged in this world; and that it was one of his greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to have ſo much wealth, and to be ſo much at eaſe, that he ſhould be raviſhed to ſee himſelf reduced to bread and water, and to get the ſame by labour, and the ſweat of his b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ows. Having one day asked him, how he could be ſo quiet amongſt all the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>idious accidents and incommodities that he ſuffered: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me, upon condition that I would keep it ſecret, that through Gods mercy, he found himſelf in a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of peace, and ſtate of indifferency in affliction, as well as in joy; and that he had no ſentiments any more of fear or deſire of any thing. And of this, my ſelf hath ſeen the experience in ſome difficulties, where the better part of his eſtate ran a great hazard, without any appearance of the leaſt commotion in him; and his words were:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seeing God hath given me the management of this eſtate, I will do to preſerve it what ſhall behove me, and then it is all one to me, what ſucceſs ſhall follow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:115611:31"/>
                     <p>Another reports thus: He had the Evangelical po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in its perfection, being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>irely eſtranged in ſpirit and thought, in heart and affection from all the wealth of the world: and he told me, that he fealt no greater croſs, than to have riches; and that he ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly glad to be a beggar and unknown, if it had been the will of God. Hence it came, that he bare a kinde of holy envy towards the poor, that he deemed them very happy; that in beholding them, he ſaid ſometimes with ſighing (but with a ſigh that one might ſee came from the bottom his heart) Ah! that I am not as they! that he honour'd, lov'd, careſs'd, and kneel'd before them, not onely in humility, but in eſteem of their eſtare, in its diſpoſing us ſo much to the perfection of the new Law, and reſemblance it hath with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Being one day viſiting the poor in the great Hoſpital of <hi>Caen,</hi> he was ſeen bare headed, and on his knees, upon the floor of the great Hall, beating in a Morter ſome Drugs for the uſe of the poor ſick people; ſuch was the reſpect and honour that he bore to thoſe, for whom he laboured, that it put him into that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</p>
                     <p>But for an end, let us hear him tell us himſelf his ſentiments upon this matter; and although he ſpeak of himſelf, lets make no ſcruple to believe him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perſon moſt worthy of credit. Behold therefore what he wrote to the Nun abovementioned:</p>

I have ſeen him at firſt in Coach with a Page

                     <p>Speaking one day to a Confident of Evangelical poverty; he told him, that God had given him ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſires to poſſeſs it, that being not able (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the bonds that withheld him) to abandon his goods, as he had often wiſhed, for the better follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the moſt (not rich, but) poor Chriſt Jeſus, made poor for us, he endeavoured to paſs with as little as he could, and to cut off for his perſon, not onely ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and the very commodious, but alſo whatever was not preciſely neceſſary: That walking alone in the Fields, his conſolation was, to be there in liberty, to live as he pleaſed: But that after all, he was not able to finde out a better cure for the fervour of his deſires, than to deſpoil himſelf as much as he was able, of the property of all his goods, and to account him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no more than a Truſtee and meer Steward in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his family, conſidering himſelf in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them, no otherwiſe, than a poor man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his neceſſaries from God by the hand of his wife.</p>
                     <p>The forementioned perſon ſpeaks of an Heroick action which this excellent man did; of which ſee here an account more at large in a Memorial, which I have under his own hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I make a reſolution in the preſence of my God, to have care of Reparations, of Manufactures, of High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and Cauſeys, with the goods that he hath given me to diſpoſe of; and this ſo much the more, as he ſhall give me the grace, to make a total diſmiſſion and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115611:33"/>to him of my ſelf, and of what I have, at this next approaching Feaſt of his Nativity, and to put my ſelf into ſuch a condition, that he ſhall be the Proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and owner, and I the ſteward and ſervant onely, to diſtribute the ſame, in readineſs to yeild it up at the leaſt notice of his will: By his grace therefore, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this day, that being from hence forward in a Plebeian and underling condition among Chriſtians, I ought to apply my ſelf to theſe buſineſſes as far as there ſhall be need, and occaſions permit; namely, to labour in them, even in the loweſt employments that are, as to remove rubbiſh, to play the Maſon, and the like; ſince by his grace I have skill in ſome of theſe Arts: And I ought to make as much account of theſe employments, as of thoſe of aſſiſting ſouls; not looking upon the things as they are in themſelves, but on the will of God, and what he requires of me: I beſeech the Lord from my heart to pardon me my failings herein, to this time: I make this preſent Memorial, upon the ſight which he hath given me of them, this fifth of</hi> November, 1643. <hi>to ſerve me as a remembrancer of my Obligation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was his reſolution and promiſe: Now let us look upon the performance. He made a building at <hi>Citry,</hi> which was one of the Demeſns he had in <hi>Bry;</hi> and the better to obſerve with what purity of Conſcience, ſublimity of thoughts, and diſingagement of affection, he applied himſelf to it, I ſhall ſet down what I had in a Letter from him corncerning it, <hi>May</hi> 8. 1648.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115611:33"/>I believe the order of God requires of me outward la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, among many other workmen, ſeeing neceſſity thereto obligeth me (as Father of the Family) about a houſe, conſiderable for my children, which was like to fall, having not been inhabited for a long time. I avow to you, my heart doth much long after another Edifice, than that which is built with materials of ſtone: But I look upon this my work, as a part of Gods juſtice, who deſtin'd the firſt man after the fall, and all his children to labour; and thereupon I revere it, and apply my ſelf thereto with a good heart and courage, though with ſome Mortification, from the nature of this penance, that relates ſo little to the life of the Spirit. We know ſome of our ancient Popes, who were great Saints, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to keep Mules, and I that am a great ſinner, and deſerve hell, and ſo mercifully dealt with, that I am not ſent, but to the ſtone Quarries, not into the baniſhment and penury of our firſt Chriſtians, but into thoſe grounds that go for my own. Oft in a day I think, that this Labour is unacceptable; and to what purpoſe, ſay I ſometimes, ſo many houſes, which we muſt leave ſo ſoon, and which themſelves will come at laſt to nothing? I am humbled for the work, but not for the application of my ſelf to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In that of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> thus he ſaid, upon the ſame ſubject:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The time that I live here in this place, I count very dear, regarding it as ordered by God, for the doing of a little part of the penance due to my great ſins. If grace did not uphold me with this conſideration, I ſhould be much tormented, in a labour ſo ingrate, and ſo limited,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115611:34"/>as to build in the houſe of a ſecular, and beſtow my time upon this work, which requires aſſiduity: But I have a feeling, that the order of God is in it, and by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I quit the ſtate of</hi> Mary, <hi>to take that of</hi> Martha, <hi>accepting this humiliation with Self-annihilation, and with contemplation of the Divine Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That which makes me the more to know that there is of Gods order in it, is this, That from time to time, both Holidays and Sundays, the mercies of the Lord are ſo great to me, that I reſent more of retribution from him in one inſtant, than the patience and humiliation of a ſinner could merit in all his life. He opens himſelf ſo to me, that my hardneſs is mollified, and makes me melt into tears; my eyes are ſo full of them, that very often I have much ado to keep them in, pierced as I am with love, with reverence, and with acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the effects of his goodneſs, which he renews in me by his inlightning preſence, and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his inexplicable conduct, which I cannot ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I underſtand hereby, that we are to reckon among graces this, following the order of God, and not that of our own, by a ſingular and private ſpirit of pride, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of God, that we may diſpence with our ſelves (though we perceive it not) from labouring in things mean and painful in our conditions, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our Lord bleſſeth, not according to the choice we make, but according to their agreement to his order: And our faithfulneſs draws not its worth from doing this or that, but from an exactneſs in doing that which he requireth of us, giving up our ſelves wholly to his good pleaſure. I ſee there is need of a great death to our ſelves, and a great depth of Self-annihilation, to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115611:34"/>follow ſo purely the conduct of grace, and not to be for own forms, but thoſe of God.</hi>

                        <hi>I daily continue my toiling here, which takes up much of my time, and almoſt all; but I dare not look aſide, but onely abaſe and ſubmit my ſelf to the Divine Ordinance. It was a work very groſs and mean, for Jeſus Christ to converſe with men, who had more of rudeneſs, than theſe ſtones I deal with, and more of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his purity, than they have to my workmens hands: And yet he ſuffered all, he bore all, and in fine, converted but a few: I beſeech you, obtain for me a part in his obedience, and his patience to the orders of God his Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And writing to one of his friends, he ſpake to him in this ſort:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am here in this Countrey, in the midſt of four or five companies of workmen, to repair a Manſion Houſe on the Demeſn of my Family, which was ready to fall: What can our ſpirit act in this work, which following the Spirit of Faith, ought to be a Pilgrime and Stranger upon earth? without doubt it groans much, not at the order of God, but after its own Countrey, in the midſt of its occupations, as things oppoſite to its liberty. We muſt do penance by labouring, it is ſo decreed by God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt tranſgreſsion.</hi>

                  <p>POverty followed the Auſterities and Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body, as having much connexion with them; and Humility follows Poverty, yet conſidering withal, that (according to S. <hi>Auſtine</hi>) the poverty in ſpirit ſpoken of by our Lord in the firſt Beatitude, is nothing elſe but humility: in very deed, there is no people in the world more poor in ſpirit, than the truly humble, becauſe they account themſelves to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to have nothing, to be able to do nothing, and to be worth nothing, to be the refuſe and off-ſcourings of the earth, and to have need of every thing, not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming any praiſe to themſelves for any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.

                  <p>And in truth, if Humility (as the all Saints tell us) be the foundation of Vertue, God having a deſign to raiſe up in him a magnificent and ſublime Palace for Vertues and Perfection, it was neceſſary the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115611:35"/>ſhould be laid very low, and his humility be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profound: He was rooted in this vertue ſo ſolidly, that it was a thing wonderful; and therein, performed a number of ſo remarkable actions, that thoſe perſons who lived many years with him, and ſingularly well knew him, have aſſured us, that it were impoſſible to relate them all.</p>
                  <p>He had in an exceſſive eſteem this important vertue, he loved it with all his heart, deſired it with extream ardor, prayed urgently, and conjured his friends to beg of God, and obtain it for him: And as we ſee the ſtone deſcend with violence, and the waters fall down impetuouſly; the ſame motion made he towards Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, as to his centre.</p>
                  <p>Out of this Sentiment, he wrote thus to one of his Confidents:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Have pitty on me, I am more unfaithful than any creature of the world: Upon my knees, I beg of you to believe it: If our Lord did not ſhew me what I am,</hi> Lucifer <hi>would not be a little rich; but this benign Lord ſhews me daily, through his mercy, my Nothingneſs, it is thither his grace leads me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To another he wrote thus:</p>

                     <hi>Our Lord Jeſus emptied himſelf to death, even the death of the croſs; wherefore God alſo hath exalted him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee here his inclination and attractive, and not without good reaſon; for conſidering firſt, that he had propounded to himſelf our Lord as a pattern for his life, with a determinate reſolution to follow him in whatſoever he could. And that ſecondly, Humility is the proper Vertue of Jeſus Chriſt, as S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> after S. <hi>Paul,</hi> calls it: he therefore embraced this Humility with his whole affection, gave himſelf up to it with all his forces, and practiſed it in its urmoſt latitude, as we are going now to ſee, by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
                  <p>But before we behold him in the actions of this Vertue, let us liſten to what he teaches, and the light he gives us concerning it.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:115611:36"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Humility; ſaid he, he is the Baſis which carries and upholds the whole work of God in us, it makes the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo naked, and ſo ſeparated from it ſelf, that it leaves it not the power to make any caſt of an eye upon it ſelf, but renders it ſo taken up in the greatneſs of God, that it becomes loſt, in reverence of him, in ſelf-abaſement and annihilation. This is the grace of Chriſtians in their Pilgrimage, who diveſted and ſpoiled of all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem themſelves but a</hi> Nothing, <hi>and very puff of being, which haivng nothing but what it received from God, hath no inſtinct or inclination, but for God: Its a brave humility to ſee nothing in ones ſelf but Nothingneſs; and he that ſees not there nothing, ſees not there any thing at all. So the ſoul which ſees nothing in it ſelf, findes nothing in it ſelf to bottom on; and by this means, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways points towards God, like a needle touched with a Loadſtone, that having been encombred with all ſorts of traſh and trifles, and afterward diſingaged of them, would forthwith turn towards her North, and thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward remain always fixt, although the tempeſt of the ſea and winds, ſhould turn upſide down the Veſſel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have we his diſpoſition, and the aſpect of ae ſoul truly humble, beholding nothing in it ſelf, and God in his Majeſtie.</p>

                     <head>SECT. 1. <hi>His Humbleneſs of Heart.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HUmility may be divided into three ſorts; The Humility of the heart, of the words, and of the works; And ſeeing the humility of the heart, is the principal and true one, of which alone, our Lord gave himſelf a ſamplar, and of which the two other are but the effects, if they be true: or otherwiſe they are but onely ſhadows and phantaſmes of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; therefore we begin with that of the heart.</p>
                     <p>And this we ſay conſiſts, in the humility of the underſtanding, and of the thoughts, of the will, and of the affections, to be well acquainted, and know truly, what a man is of himſelf, and that he is meer Nothingneſs and ſin; and in conſequence of this knowledge, to take up moſt mean and low opinions of himſelf; to judge himſelf unworthy of all eſteem and praiſe, to abaſe himſelf, and love his own abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A thing moſt excellently performed by this perfect follower of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>He had ſo low an opinion of himſelf, that it would be a difficult thing to unfold it; and although he had moſt rare qualities, natural and ſupernatural, yet he ſaw nothing in himſelf, but as we have ſaid, the Nothingneſs, and the ſin: And out of a true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere perſwaſion, he thought himſelf the moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all men; aſſuming that title in ſome of his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115611:37"/>Letters, but the name which uſually he gave himſelf was, <hi>Sinner,</hi> and <hi>A great Sinner,</hi> which he repeated very often, and with a ſpirit truly humbled.</p>
                     <p>That which I have noted in him for the ſpace of ſix years, wherein I have had the honour of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (ſaid a perſon worthy of belief) was a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found humility, which kept him in a perpetual ſelf-abnegation before God and the creatures, but after ſuch a manner, as I have never ſeen in any man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, although I have been acquainted with moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſouls: The greatneſs of God humbled him, even to an abyſs or immeaſurable depth;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And is there</hi> (ſaid he, one day to me) <hi>any thing great, in the preſence of that Greatneſs? I ſee my ſelf there ſo little, ſo little, and nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And afterwards being elevated to God in this Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of littleneſs, he ſaid:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A mote in the Sun is very little, but yet I am far leſs in the preſence of God, for I am not any thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards humbling himſelf in another ſenſe, he ſaid,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alaſs, I am too much; I am a ſinner, and Infidel, an Anathema through my crimes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And beſides, he wrote to the ſame perſon thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Methinks I break my ſelf in pieces before God, as when I ſtamp an egg in pieces with my foot upon the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115611:38"/>ground, and I be ſpoken of, that I have ſo much as a name, is a ſtrange thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſo exceeding baſe opinion which he had of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, made him ſay oftner than once, and ready to weep, that he was much aſtoniſhed at the goodneſs of men, in ſuffering of him; and that he could not enough won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, why every where they threw not dirt at him, and that all the creatures did not bandy againſt him. This ſame opinion had perſwaded him, that it was much boldneſs in him to ſpeak, and that men ſhewed great mercy toward him in enduring his converſation, which he believed was very burthenſome.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen him very often (ſaith a perſon of piety, that well knew him) humble himſelf even to the centre of the earth, while he ſpake to me of God, ſaying, it was not for a man of his condition to ſpeak of him, but that he ought rather to contain himſelf in ſilence: And ſo, he ſpake not of God, without ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inducement that our Lord gave him, either for the neceſſity of his neighbour, or for ſome other good which God would draw thence for his glory; keeping a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from this diſcourſe out of humility, as if he had not known how to ſpeak two words of him. In a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to another, he ſaid:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let us live as we are in truth; what place can we hold before God and his Saints, but that of Nothing? with amazement, that we are endured, being a Nothing of all good, and a compound of all evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This humility of heart, was general in him, becauſe he practiſed it in each thing, there being not the leaſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115611:38"/>thing that ſerv'd him not for an abaſement. He abaſed himſelf much, in the conſideration of the feebleneſs of our nature; whereof he wrote to me one day this ſentiment:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It concerns me to tell you one thing before I end, which keeps me in a marvellous diſeſteem of my ſelf, and makes me reſent, how little confidence there is to be had in man: it is this, that when S.</hi> Peter <hi>and the Apoſtles make the greateſt profeſsion of their fidelity to our Lord, our Lord then mindes them of the infidelity they would commit, ſaying to S.</hi> Peter, <hi>that he could not follow him whether he went. S.</hi> Peter <hi>anſwers him, Why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not I follow you now? I am ready to give my life for you. Thou give thy life for me (replies our Lord) I tell you in truth, the Cock ſhall not crow, but thou ſhalt deny me thrice: S.</hi> Peter <hi>not underſtanding theſe words, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in the proteſting of his fidelity; and upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the apprehending of our Lord, draws his ſword, and ſheaths it not again, till our Lord commands him: He follows him, and forſakes him not, thus apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but yet afterward, he denies him upon the bare word of a maid ſervant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The apprehenſions of theſe weakneſſes, which come to me not by ſearch or ſtudy, but by Divine enlightning, and by the impreſſion which they make in me, keep me wholly in annihilation, without any affiance in my ſelf, which I place altogether in God and his Son our Lord: This condition would keep me in a marvellous littleneſs, if I were faithful therein: I have ſome inſtances, when methinks my whole body is cruſh'd, bruiſed, annthilated, and my interior much more.</hi>

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:115611:39"/>
                     <p>To another perſon he wrote:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pitty it is to ſee man and his infirmity, it is ſometime important, that he have experience of what he is, that he may neither forget himſelf, nor the place which he ought to hold,</hi> ut non glorietur omnis caro in conſpectu ejus, <hi>[That no fleſh might glory in his ſight] that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abaſed, nullified, and rendred as a thing that is not at all, Jeſus Chriſt may be in him, the life of grace and holineſs, waiting for the time of our redemption; that is to ſay, the entry into his glory, and as it is written,</hi> he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>
                     <p>And to another thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The state of our poverty, and the ſight of our miſeries, makes us know the need we have of grace, and ſettles the ſoul upon the Nothingneſs of her ſelf, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of her inability to all good; and in this truth, that ſhe never hath been, nor can be, but retardment and diminution to the operations of God in her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The knowledge of his faults and ſins, humbling him ſtrangely (as indeed they are the moſt juſt, and greateſt cauſes a man can have of humiliation) made him write one day to me thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I aſſure you, I lack for no matter to make me humble, and to labour in good earneſt, to correct my ſelf, although with patience; for I experiment and ſee clearly, that though we labour and wiſh earneſtly to get out of our imperfections, our Lord ſometimes leaves us there a long while, to make us know our weakneſs, and to humble us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:115611:39"/>
                     <p>He deſired to be advertiſed of, and reprehended for, his faults, and we ſhall ſee now what he obſerved therein, at the beginning of his call to this high per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. It came to paſs, that a perſon which was much below him, had order from his Director to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe him, if he ſaw any thing in him that was contrary to perfection, when this perſon gave him notice of ſome failing, though very light, and indeed but of the ſhadow of a fault, he liſtned thereto with reſpect and thanks, and humbled himſelf for it, as if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome crime; and he accuſed himſelf, when he thought he had made any failing, upon his knees, ſaying, he was a miſerable ſinner, and that he had committed ſuch a fault, which yet often, very hardly could one diſcern to be any. This exerciſe, as being moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and efficacious, was very uſeful to him, for the making of a great progreſs; for our nature, by reaſon of its feebleneſs, hath need of ſuch props to walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, and not fall.</p>
                     <p>If his imperfections and his ſins humbled him, his excellent qualities, and the graces which he received from God, did the ſame alſo: And the ſame things, from which the greateſt part of men draw nothing but vanity, ſerved him for motives of ſelf-abaſement: The Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, wherewith he was enlivened, extremely eſtranged him from the Grandeurs of the world, making him not onely contemn them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be aſhamed thereof; ſo that he took occaſions of abaſements from his own condition, becauſe ſo high in the world, and from the ſecular advantages which it gave him; which made him often to groan before the Majeſtie of God, and to ſay, that he was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115611:40"/>in a condition very low and plebeian, according to the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and that he had great confuſion to ſee himſelf in that eſtate.</p>
                     <p>From whence it came, that being born a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of ſo good rank, as we have ſaid, he renounced his Nobility, and gave it into the hands of our Lord, who, in return, imparted his own to him (as he made it known to a holy ſoul;) that is to ſay, his love, which by its proper force; transforming man in God, diveſts him of himſelf, and leaves nothing in him but God alone, there living and reigning; and by this means, raiſeth him thus Deified to the higheſt degree of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that he can mount to: Hence it was, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured with pain, that one ſhould call him Monſieur; and he ſaid ſometimes ſmilingly, among his familiars, I am a fine Monſieur, it is well for me; and in his Letters, he complained that they treated him as in that quality: And in one of them, giving another [courſe] or carreer to his humility, he ſaid,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Believe me, I pray you, it is great pitty of me, I take again the Monſieur, which I had rejected, my pride muſt have theſe her Appendixes, rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your Candor, which elſe perhaps make you miſtake in me, a piece of glittering glaſs for a Diamond.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Out of his humility it was, that he would not bear the title of Marqueſs (which was due to him, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to his houſe, in regard the Emperor, <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, had erected <hi>Renty</hi> into a Marquifate) and he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered onely that of Baron of <hi>Renty,</hi> by which he was commonly called.</p>
                     <p>For the graces and gifts of God, as they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115611:40"/>in a ſoul well diſpoſed, ſo produced they moſt excellently their true effect, which was to abaſe and elevate the ſoul both together, to raiſe it to God, and to abaſe it to it ſelf. And firſt, his humility made him hide as much as he could the gifts of God, and ſo hath rob'd us of the knowledge of a thouſand brave actions, which might have been very ſerviceable to this Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when he received any favour from God, or that one rendred him any honour, the light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſaw the Nothingneſs of the creature, and the diſcernment he was endowed with, in diſtinguiſhing the precious from the vile, and that which is done on Gods part, in all-good things, from that which man bringeth thither of his own, was the cauſe, that in thoſe things he aſſum'd no ſhare at all; but referred all to God, as to the true Source; and ſo in the management of theſe great goods, which God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched him withal, he had always his hands clean, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing wrong to God, or touching that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain'd to him; and for himſelf, he kept quite out of ſight of all vanity, which ſlides moſt ſubtilly and moſt eaſily into a ſpirit, that abounds in riches of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as well as thoſe of the earth, if he look not very cloſe unto it.</p>
                     <p>Nor would he therefore, that any one ſhould conſider him, in what he ſaid or did; but regard God alone therein: He wrote thus to one that much deſired of him a viſit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I cannot bear, but with pain, the account you make of my viſits and ſociety: Let us look much upon God, let us binde our ſelves ſtrictly to Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115611:41"/>that we may learn of him a profound annihilation of our ſelves. O my God, when will it be, that we ſhall have no more a ſight upon our ſelves, when we ſhall ſpeak no more of our ſelves, and when all vanity ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he wrote to another:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I beſeech you not to regard in me, ſave my infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and a depth of wickedneſs, and pride very hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible that is in me, that's it, for which I ſhall have need that all the world talk to, and puniſh me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the third place, he eſteemed himſelf moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the graces and favours of God, and beleived there was not one of them, how little ſoever it were, but was far above his merits; and for the great ones, he was ſo full of, they did put him to a Non-plus. He wrote to a confident:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The gifts of God are ſometimes ſo great, that they put us, as I may ſo ſay, beyond our ſelves (and if it were poſſible we could finde the means to recoil our ſelves further off, than beyond Nothingneſs) we ſhould do it. You ſee among men, that when one receives a gift that bears ſome proportion to him, he renders thanks and acknowledgement to the giver for it; but if a Prince be Liberal to a poor man, according to the Grandeur of his own power, whether it be a ſum of money, or a place, you ſhall ſee this poor man recoil, and ſay, Alas, my Lord, I think you know me not, I muſt not have ſo much, I am unworthy of it: In like manner, there are bleſsings that go beyond our expectations, capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and which make us ſee what we are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115611:41"/>daring to lift up our eyes towards them, their brightneſs doth ſo much dazle, and their greatneſs ſo much aſtoniſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, he humbled himſelf always for the favours of God, becauſe he thought that either by his ſloth, he was not anſwerable to their extent; or that by the ſole miſery of nature, he uſed them, and made them loſe ſome part of their force, as it happens to Plants of the <hi>Levant,</hi> which removed into a ſtrange ſoil, do not retain their vertue, but degenerate, and ſavour of the earth, they are removed to: And if the ſpiritual things of nature are allayed and corrupted in their paſſage through our ſenſes, how much more reaſon is there to think, that the Divine and ſpiritual things of grace, will there become enfeebled and altered. Theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations rendred him moſt humble, even in the greateſt gifts of God, and in things of moſt ſublimity.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115611:42"/>Spirit of God in a ſoul) was to be always condemning of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>He wrote to his Director:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have at the ſame time two apprehenſions, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; the one, to avow to you, with thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement to God, that he fills me with effects of his goodneſs, and impreſsions of his Kingdom; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I am more diſpoſed to condemn, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard my ſelf; for upon the whole, what I do is pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another time, after ſome ſpeech to him of many great enlightnings and excellent ſentiments which God had communicated to him; he told him,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I reſt not upon all this; I told you onely what is paſt, to render you an account, not making uſe of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to condemn my ſelf for vices, ſuſpending it as to other things, and committing it to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He wrote to another Confident:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I know not what will become of our buſineſs, one muſt not ſpeak a word in ſweetneſs and patience, but I ſhall loſe my credit ſomewhat; if this could be throughly loſt, it would be great juſtice: Alas, if no body endur'd me, and all the world condemn'd me, my pride perhaps would be humbled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Carried on by this Spirit, he had an ardent deſire (though always with his ordinary tranquillity, and giving himſelf up to the orders of God) to receive ſome diſgrace:</p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:115611:42"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If I were to wiſh any thing, it ſhould be, to be much humbled and nullified, and to be treated as an off-ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by others: This would be my joy, but I believe I deſerve not ſo great a favour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This deſire carried him to ſuch a point, that had he not been withheld with the conſideration of greater good, he had done ſtrange things, to be diſeſteemed and receive confuſion: Out of this ſentiment and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of his heart, he ſaid thus to one:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſhould have great pleaſure, if it were permitted me, to go naked in my ſhirt through the streets of</hi> Paris, <hi>to make my ſelf diſeſteemed, and taken for a fool.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whence we muſt obſerve two things: the firſt, that God gives ſometimes to holy ſouls, ſome thoughts, affections and deſires, ſo raiſed above the common pitch and humane reaſon, that they may ſeem extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant; as this here which he gave to Monſieur <hi>de Renty,</hi> and which was, before him alſo, in our founder S. <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The ſecond is, that we muſt not at all put in execution ſuch deſires, till before hand, they have been well examined, and juſtly weighed in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Charity, and edification of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                     <p>This burning deſire which he had to be dieſteemed, made him ſeek for, and love his own abjection, and when it came, to take it, not onely with patience, but alſo (which is the higheſt ſtep that one can mount in humility) with joy. He gave an evident and notable
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115611:43"/>teſtimony thereof in the firſt journey he made to <hi>Dijon,</hi> whither a ſuit that he had with the Lady his Mother, and which to him by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſpenſation of God, was one of the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of patience and humiliation, that he underwent in all his life (of which I ſhall ſpeak more at large in the following Chapter) had obliged him to go: for thus he wrote to his Director the 24. of <hi>July,</hi> 1643.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am at</hi> Dijon <hi>now, ſeeing God is ſo pleaſed; where I have learnt by the prejudicate opinions, that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained concerning me, what it is that God would draw from my journey; which is, that I lead a life ſecret and unknown to men in the ſpirit of penance. The bruit which they had ſpread concerning me was, that I was a Bigot, and had nothing but artifices and ſhews of devotion, for the colouring of my naughtineſs; that indeed I have kept my ſelf much private in my cloſet, out of fear to give, by coming abroad, rather ſcandal, than any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of vertue: I have found a generality that ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited againſt me, though ſuch as from whom I had good cauſe methinks, for divers good reaſons, to hope for a prop, than from any other, but have found the quite contrary: But ſo alſo, as God hereby hath done me many favours. I have been to ſee them, where I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived humiliation, with great joy: I have been very wary of opening my ſelf in any thing that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me unto them: I have onely done in my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs what truth required, and for any thing elſe, I made it matter of confuſion and humiliation, as I ought to do: I ſhall be here, I believe, as one excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and the Scape-Goat of the old Law, chaſed into the wilderneſs for my enormous ſins, for which I am of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115611:43"/>opinion God would have me do penance, not by meer pain onely, but by ſuch, as withal brings ſhame and confuſion with it: I tell you this, to render you ſome account, not dwelling on it any longer; my ſole ſcope being to love God, and to condemn my ſelf.</hi>

                     <p>THe Humility of heart in which Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> was deeply rooted, produced in him the Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeech, which hindred him ever from ſpeaking any word that ſavoured of vaunting, or that carryed the leaſt tincture of arrogance, and eſteem of himſelf, or which was uttered in a haughty manner, or in a tone imperious or conceited; but on the contrary, they were all of them tempered with humility and modeſty: and as he deemed himſelf to be indeed a ſinner, lazy, ungrateful, perfidious, ignorant, ſo did he ſet forth, and qualifie himſelf with theſe names and titles: We have ſeen hereof already ſomething before, whereto we will adde alſo this, which he writ to a certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He wrote to another perſon:</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Seeing I am born with ſo willingly, and that you perſevere to deſire this of me, I beſeech my Lord, in the hand and diſpoſing of whom I would be wholly, that he make uſe (if it pleaſe him) of this miſerable Ruſh, for the giving you ſome conſolation, in the life of his children, and the ways which may lead you to the inheritance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He writ a great number of Letters, and it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing, that there is not among them ſo much as one, wherein he doth not villifie himſelf, and which carries not with it ſome touch of humility; and he did the ſame too in all his converſation: For although
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115611:44"/>he had a deſign to annihilat himſelf the more, &amp; to do that which generally ſpeaking, is conceived to be the beſt (except in occurrences where vertue obligeth us to practice the contrary) to ſpeak nothing of himſelf at all, neither good nor ill, yet was to him almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to retain himſelf from it, in regard of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding low opinion and diſeſteem he had of himſelf; whereupon when a Confident of his, ſaid one day to him, This was not well done to ſpeak ſo ill of your ſelf, he preſently ſmote his breaſt, avowing, <hi>He did ill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Its true, that a man may ſpeak ill of himſelf through pride, upon deſign to skim off to himſelf by this falſe humility, a little glory, and to get ſome reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an humble perſon; but when all is done, we finde not that the proud are much ſubject to this fault, at leaſt thus much we ſhall finde, that it is very hard to ſpeak of ones ſelf from ſo great depth of humility as did this man of God.</p>
                     <p>Who indeed ſpake of himſelf very ill, and in terms of great confuſion, and very often; but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, without moleſtation or annoying of any one, and in ſuch a manner, that we might evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee, that he ſpake from the bottom of his heart, and as he thought: And that which is yet more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, he had ſuch a grace in ſpeaking ill of himſelf, and to his confuſion, that many have marked, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented, that the words of humility and confuſion which he ſaid of himſelf, did imprint the ſame diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in them that heard him, bringing into their ſouls the ſame effects of ſelf-leſſening, and ſentiments of of humility.</p>
                     <p>When by the particular motion of the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115611:45"/>he ſpake of ſuch graces and mercies as God had ſhewed him, it was always with an humbled and ſelf-annulling ſpirit, He wrote to a perſon thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am no other than a ſinner, have pitty on me, adoring for me the goodneſs of God, and of our Lord; who, to ſpeak in the tearms of the Goſpel, turns in ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſinners: I can tell ſome news of that with</hi> Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, <hi>but I am confounded, for not producing in all my life, that which his love and gratitude made him do in a moment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to another:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I beſeech our Lord to keep me very low, before him, and before you; for I ought to bear the ſhame of my crimes in all places, ſeeing I am altogether miſerable; yet ſo as without ceaſing to joyn with you in ſaying,</hi> Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordias Domini in aeternum Cantabo <hi>[I will ſing of the mercies of God for ever.]</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>AFter the humility of the heart and ſpeech, comes that of action; which Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> practiſed in an excellent manner: We have already ſeen it in divers paſſages, we ſhall ſee it again in many other, and particularly when we ſpeak of his patience, and of his charity towards the poor, and the ſick: But beſides all this, I ſhall not doubt to ſay, that he was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attentive to all occaſions of Humility, ſo that none of them eſcaped him, without being made uſe of.</p>
                     <p>Since his ſpecial vocation to the ſervice of God, he would not ſuffer they ſhould carry him any more a cuſhion to the Church; but, to be there hid and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded, he mingled himſelf among Mechanicks and mean perſons; where he was often crowded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded, as not being known, which he endured with great delight: He kept himſelf alway as much as he could (with the humble Publican) at the lower end of the Church: And at <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115611:46"/>he might not, ſaid he, put any to the trouble of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to a poor ſinner. When he heard high Maſs in his Pariſh, he went always to the Offertory, together with ſome poor man, and was ſeen ſometimes with the ſame to accompany the Holy Sacrament through the ſtreets, when no man of note was there but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf onely.</p>
                     <p>During the war at <hi>Paris,</hi> he went himſelf to buy bread for the poor, carrying it through the ſtreets, and as much of it too as his ſtrength would permit. As alſo at the ſame time, when he did the charity to a Monaſtery of Nuns, as to take in cuſtody their Church plate, he preſſed them very much, to let him carry to his lodging (which was almoſt two miles thence) and on foot as he was, a piece very great and weighty; but as he had the humility to deſire it, ſo had they the diſcretion not to permit it: When they deſired him at the ſame Monaſtery, that when he was pleaſed to do them the favour to viſit them, he would come in his Coach, by reaſon of the diſtance, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity he received in coming: He anſwered pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he lov'd not to make uſe of a Coach, becauſe that ſmelt ſomething of the Monſieur, and that he muſt endeavour to make himſelf in every thing very little; He went therefore thither on foot, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhorteſt days at five or ſix a clock at night, all alone, and ſometimes in thawing weather; when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told of the great pains he took, he made anſwer, that our Lord humbled himſelf, and took toilſome pains for the good of ſouls, in a far other manner ſure, and that he was his pattern.</p>
                     <p>Being one day to go ſee a perſon of very great quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, about a buſineſs which much concerned the glory
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115611:46"/>of God, he would not uſe his Coach, although he were to traverſe in a manner all <hi>Paris,</hi> and that when it pour'd down with rain, but go thither on foot; one motioned, that he would at leaſt let a cloak be carried by a Lackey, to take it when he came thither, and not preſent himſelf before that perſon in a Cloak altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wet, and ſpeak to him in ſuch unſeemlineſs, but he yielded not; yet to accommodate his humility with decency, he caſt that cloak above his own, and paſt through the ſtreets, ſo far in this humble equipage; and afterwards in the Noblemans houſe, laid aſide the wet cloak, and appeared in the other ordinary one of his own.</p>
                     <p>But behold here another effect of this humility, whereof he wrote to his Director the 20 of <hi>December,</hi> 1646.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It behoves me now, ſaith he, that I render you an account of a buſineſs that paſſed the other day: Madam, my Lord Chancellors Lady, ſent me a packet of letters, wherein I found ſome from the King with all the Seals and formalities, wherein I was made Councellor of State, but my thoughts were not taken up at all with the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I ſent her word, that I would aſſume the honour to ſee her, to thank her, for that my Lord Chancellor vouchſafed to think of me; that I honoured more than ſo, that which had the mark of the King, and which came from their hands, than not to receive it with all reſpect: But I moſt humbly begg'd one thing of her, that living in a kinde of plain and vulgar manner, as I did, ſhe would be pleaſed to take in good part, if (with all acknowledgement premiſed of my exceeding obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them) I did not accept thoſe letters, and that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115611:47"/>the buſineſs might ſleep without noiſe: ſome repreſented it to me as a thing worth thinking on, for that a</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittimus <hi>might be very neceſsary for me, in ſome ſort of occurrences; and that a penſion of</hi> 2000 <hi>livers</hi> per ann. [<hi>about</hi> 200 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling] <hi>would afford me ability for the giving of more alms. To the firſt point I anſwered, that by the goodneſs of God, I had no need of it; and that often, the Committimuſſes prove a great vexation to thoſe upon whom they are executed: That this ſhould be our work, to bear our own little ordinary croſſes, without laying extraordinary ones upon others. And for the ſecond, that God having given me more of riches, than I had need of, I thought I was not obliged to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, but to keep me in my little way of living: you ſee how we stand as to this buſineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whereupon let me tell you, that this thing cannot be affected ſo, but that I muſt take upon me alſo the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Councellor of State, and muſt have a dependence upon the State, as a Penſioner of the King. Now by the paper that ſome while ago I ſent you, you may ſee that I have given up my worldly Nobility to God, and this thing here, would derogate much from it; and moreover, it would be a ſtep to an engaging of me I know not where, which now I ſee not, nor will ſee, having other things to ſix my eyes on. My diſpoſition towards affairs of that nature, is to have no ſhare at all in them: if per-force, and without my ſeeking, they come upon me, I ſhall count it a real croſs, which our Lord will in ſuch a caſe give me ſtrength to bear. To conclude,</hi> Elegi abjectus eſſe in domo dei mei, &amp; abſit mihi glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riari niſii in cruce domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti [I have choſen to be a door-keeper in the houſe of my God, and God forbid that I ſhould rejoyce in any thing,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115611:47"/>ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt.] <hi>So have you the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I finde in my ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was that he writ to him, concluding with theſe words, which carry with them another touch of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and much wiſdom:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have been willing the buſineſs might be concealed, for the avoiding of Oſtentation, which is found often in the refuſal of things that have ſomething of luſtre, and give occaſion of talk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus he carried himſelf in that conjuncture; but notwithſtanding, ſometime after, he was conſtrained by good advice, in conſideration of a buſineſs that much concerned the glory of God, and relief of the poor, to accept of theſe letters, and that quality, and to make uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>In a paper he wrote to the ſame perſon, I finde this that follows, which makes much to our purpoſe:</p>

                        <hi>Walking one day this</hi> Lent <hi>thorow the ſtreets of</hi> Paris, <hi>much be-dirted, and very poor to look at, I bore in me the reſentment of the Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.13. <hi>when he ſaith,</hi> That he was as the ſcum and off-ſcouring of the world: <hi>I returned (in my minde) bleſsing for reviling, and the reſt of that paſſage, ſo much as fell under my paſsive obedience, both actually receiving illumination to underſtand it, and ſtrength to execute it: I know well how much neatneſs and new things, even to a boot, even to a glance, and a look, do hurt, if one take not good heed, the ſimplicity and dignity of this Chriſtian ſelf-vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                     </p>
                     <p>The great knowledge and marvellous ſenſe that he had of theſe truths, and of the lowlineſs of Spirit (whither ought to tend and come the true children of God, and perfect followers of Jeſus Chriſt) made him often to ſay:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let us be little, and very little: Oh this holy little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is a great matter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From this Spirit it was, that he loved low and mean things, and ſhun'd whatſoever it was that outwardly carried ſplendor with it; whither he knew, that nature (in a ſecret reflex upon it ſelf) is always carried, and even in things moſt ſpiritual and holy: as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Grace (as being the grace of Jeſus Chriſt) carries to things of no reputation, ſuch as he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>
                     <p>And he avoided, out of the fame thought, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was that held of the extraordinary; and ſaid, that in exerciſes, wherein there appeared even moſt of perfection, as in obſerving Faſts and other penances more than others, there was not in them ſometimes ſo
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115611:49"/>much, as in the common exerciſes; for the meanneſs of which is recompenced with the mortification of our nature; which nature very often ſeeks its ſelf in the extraordinaries, and the ſingularities; being much pleaſed to have ſomething above others, and ſo be thought of and ſpoken of, with the more eſteem.</p>
                     <p>He kept the ſame guard upon his ſpeech, that he might not in diſcourſing of ſpiritual things, and the higheſt myſteries, make any uſe of terms magnifick and pompous, or of words new and uncouth; and if it fell out, that he uttered any ſuch, he ſhewed it was with pain, and becauſe he could not expreſs himſelf otherways; inſomuch, that neither in his actions, nor in his words, would he have any thing that made appearance of Grandeur, or of ſingularity.</p>
                     <p>It was moreover an act of humility and wiſdom in him, to make eſteem, and to ſpeak with advantage, of other mens carriages for their Interior, although they were far below his own, ſaying, that we ought moſt carefully take heed, of ſpeaking like the Phariſee, <hi>I am not as other men.</hi> And writing to me one day of this ſubject:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God forbid, ſaid he, that I ſhould believe, there is any thing ſingular and extraordinary in me, although I ow him extream acknowledgements for his infinite mercies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But among all the effects and teſtimonies of his humility, the manner of his carriage towards his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, ought, without doubt, to have place in the firſt rank: He did nothing, were it of never ſo little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that concerned himſelf, without his conduct;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115611:50"/>to him he propounded the thing, either by word of mouth, if he were preſent, or if abſent, by writing, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and punctually, deſiring his advice, his pleaſure, and benediction upon his reſolution: Theſe were his terms, and that with ſo much humility, reſpect, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and ſubmiſſion of his own ſenſe, as was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable; and after, without return or diſputing, he followed ſimply and exactly his order, even as much as could be done, in a well reformed Religious order, by the moſt reſigned and obſequious novice.</p>
                     <p>His director having written to him ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his perfection, he anſwered him in theſe terms:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I beſeech you believe, that although I am moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and a great ſinner, if yet you do me the honour and favour to ſend me a word of what you know to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me, I hope, with Gods help, I ſhall profit thereby: I pant not after any thing, but to finde God, and Jeſus Chriſt, with as much ſimplicity, as verity: I pretend to nothing in this world, but this, and out of this I deſire nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>See what a ſubmiſſion here was: although he had (which makes the marvel) an excellent and moſt clear ſpirit; and was endued with ſo high prudence, and great inſight in each thing, that he was conſulted by word of mouth and by letters, from diverſe places, by a very great number of perſons, of every age, ſex, and condition, both of Secular and Religious.</p>
                     <p>For the practiſing ſo highly this ſubmiſſion, he fixed his eyes upon our Lord (who in each thing was his model, and his light) in that ſubmiſſion which he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115611:50"/>to S. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> wherewith he was extraordinarily affected. Being one day at the Carmelite Nuns of <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> praying in their Church, and opening him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this matter, to a perſon to whom with prudence and charity he might do it, he thus told him:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is true, that I have received this morning a grand favour, in the weditation on the ſubjection and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency which the ſon of God was pleaſed to render to S.</hi> Joſeph, <hi>to whom he was ſubject and obedient in all things as a childe to his Father. Oh what an honour and grace was it to this Saint! but Oh, what a vertue and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annihilation in, Jeſus Christ! that the Son of God, being equal to his Father, ſhould be ſubject to a creature, and ſubmit to a poor Carpenter, as if he had not known how to demean himſelf? I am given to underſtand, how by this example of the Son of God, we are highly inſtructed (and after a manner worthy ſuch a Maſter) concerning the dependance which the Creatures ought to have upon God, and concerning the ſtrict obligation which engageth us to ſubmit to the Soveraign power which he hath over us; and to the direction of men, in ſuch ſort, that our heart may not have repoſe but in this ſubjection, united to that which Chriſt Jeſus renders to a Creature: O how profound is this myſterie, and how it teacheth me!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſaid, he continued a while after without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if he had been wholly taken up with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this grace: and the perſon to whom he ſpake, having told him that he felt ſome communication of this grace, he fell down on his knees, and ſo did that perſon alſo, and both of them praying, adored Jeſus
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115611:51"/>Chriſt, in this eſtate of dependence and ſubmiſſion to a creature, devoting themſelves to him for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>VVE place alſo as an effect of his humility, the love he had to a private and unknown life; for he loved it not onely for its affording him more time to attend upon God, and communicate more with our Lord, who was the dear object of his heart: but the more, for having thereby the means, to fly from the eſteem, the honour, and the praiſes of men, and to be blotted out of their mindes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in oblivion to all the world.</p>
                     <p>Being preſſed with this love, he ſaid, that if God had not tied him to this ſtate, wherein he was, he ſhould have gone into ſome ſtrange and remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to live there in obſcurity the reſt of his days; that he wiſhed not to be known by any one in the world, that it was not expedient that one ſhould know ſo much, as that he was there, and that it would have been a ſingular pleaſure to him to be baniſhed from the hearts of all men, and unknown by all the creatures; whereunto he contributed, on his part, all that he could, not doing any thing that might bring on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and gain affections; and it was noted, that the more he advanced in light and graces, the more
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115611:51"/>ſtrong grew the Bent he had [plant] to this hidden life and deſire to be unknown, as he witneſſed five or ſix moneths before his death.</p>
                     <p>He beheld herein our Lord, and he example that he gave us of this life, not having appeared for the ſpace of thirty years, but once onely in the Temple, although there was no danger on his part, to be frequented by men; and one would think alſo, he might thereby have done them much good, in cultivating, poliſhing, and ſanctifying them, by his converſation, and by his words, being indeed come into the world on purpoſe to teach them. He caſt alſo his eyes upon God, whom the Prophet calls <hi>a Secret God,</hi> and who effectually hath kept himſelf hid a whole Eternity within himſelf, and who through all the diſcoveries that he hath made of himſelf, which is ſhewed abroad, is nothing near anſwerable to what is ſtill undiſcovered within him. Theſe were the models after which this ſervant of God and illuminated ſoul, faſhioned himſelf.</p>
                     <p>In a Memorial written the fifth of <hi>March,</hi> 1645. which he gave to his Director, to render him an account of that which paſſed in his Interior, he ſaid:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>One time, being in the ſtreet, where coaches paſſed to and fro, and not knowing whether I ought or no, look on them that were in them (becauſe it was in a place of my acquaintance) and whether this would not give ſome occaſion of talk, to ſee that I went in that manner on, not looking at all aſide; I had on a ſudden upon my ſpirit, but after a manner that I cannot doubt but it was of God,</hi> Trouble not thy ſelf about being known; <hi>and,</hi> Stand not upon knowing: <hi>Theſe two words gave me ſo great light and force, that I dwelt more than eight
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115611:52"/>upon this Contemplation, That herein conſiſts the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aids of the life ſpiritual, and I have it daily for a ground.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is certain, that ſince the greateſt part of our evils and imperfections come from a deſire to be ſeen, and to ſee, this amuſement muſt have in it great venome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the advancement of a ſoul, although ſhe often perceives not the damage, nor feels the hurt that comes from it. That which defiles our actions of Piety, is, that ſelf-love makes one glad when they are known and obſerved; men ſhew always the moſt fair, and hide the foul, and inſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>; and all the outſide is ſo compoſed, that the minde is often more taken up about that, than about God: And very few there are, that have not a great part in this vain eying and regard, paſſive and active, of the creatures. O how theſe words wrought in me a great ſeparation from the world! what purgation and, and what purity is it, to be upon the earth, and there ſee nought but God! O how (undoubtedly) ſuch a one would live, as if he were not known, without caring what the world ſays or thinks, without deſire of taking or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any part there, of knowing or being known of any, neither by name, livery or viſage, but according as our Lord did: How one would march naked, pure, and free of ſpirit: I was then in t he midst of the ſtreets, and of noiſe among crouding and juſtling, in ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, ſo united to God, and ſo much taken up by him, as if I had been in a deſart; and ſince that time I go thus through the ſtreets, yet with liberty to look upon what I ſhould ſee, but without being fixt to it. And theſe words are again ſent into my ſpirit in neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, and they keep and conſerve me in God, I am for all that very unfaithful to this Grace, but the centre
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115611:52"/>and the ground of it is not blotted out of me, and this renders me more culpable,</hi> Thus we have what was in his Memorial.</p>
                     <p>Let us end with what he wrote to a Lady, 1643. upon this buſineſs, of a life that is ſecret, and retired from communion with the creatures, to whom he ſaid:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let us encourage our ſelves, to lead this life unknown, and wholy hid from men, but moſt known to &amp; intimate with God, diveſting our ſelves, &amp; chaſing out of our mind, all thoſe many ſuperfluities, and thoſe many amuſements, which bring with them ſo great a damage, that they take up our mindes, inſtead of God: ſo that when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that, which thwarts and cuts into ſo many pieces, this holy, this ſweet, and amiable union, which we ſhould have continually with God, it appears that it is onely a Monſieur, a Madam, a complement, and talking; indeed a meer foolery, which notwithſtanding doth raviſh and wreſt from us the time that is ſo precious and the fellowſhip that is ſo holy and ſo deſireable: Let us quit this, I pray you, and learn to court it with our own Maſter, let us well underſtand our part, our own world (as we here phraſe it) not that world, I mean, which we do renounce, but that wherein the children of God do their duties to their Father.</hi>

                  <p>THat great affection which he bore to an obſcure life, was an evident mark of his diſeſteem of the world; for if he had eſteemed it, he would not have deſired to quit it: Now to ſay to what height he mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the diſeſteem of it, is a thing very difficult: 'Tis enough for us to know, that he had it in extream con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by obſerving (as aboveſaid) how he renounced, as far as in him lay, all that the world could promiſe, and could give him; and wherewith it uſeth to enſlave and captivate men; how he degraded himſelf of his Nobility, how he yielded up his goods, and ſtript him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of their property, as no otherwiſe to uſe them, than in quality of a poor man; withdrew himſelf from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, rejected the honors &amp; dignities to which his birth and excellent perfection gave him very great overtures; how he floured all its allurements, trampled under foot all its glories, He beheld for this end, our Lord as his pattern, who from his entry into the world and birth, made an open profeſſion of an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world; becauſe (as he ſaid) he was not of the world.</p>

                     <hi>Being, ſaith he, in the moneth of</hi> November, 1644. <hi>in a Chappel, richly Wainſcoted, and adorned with very excellent Sculpture, and with Imagery, I beheld it with ſome attention, having had ſome skill in theſe things, and ſaw the bundels of flowers diluces, and of flowers in form of borders, and of very curious workmanſhip; it was on a ſudden put into my minde,</hi> The original of what thou ſeeſt, would not detain thee at all in ſeeing it. <hi>And I perceived, that indeed all theſe, and thoſe flowers themſelves (and not in picture) would not have taken me up; and all the ornaments which Architecture and Art inventeth, are but things moſt mean and low, running in a manner onely upon Flowers, Fruits, Branches, Harpies, and Chymaera's, part whereof are in their very being but things common and vile, and part of them meerly imaginary; and yet man (who croucheth to every thing) renders himſelf amorous, and a ſlave of them; no otherwiſe, than as if a good workman, ſhould ſtand to copy out, and counterfeit ſome trifles and ſoppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. I conſidered by this ſight, how poor man was, to be cheated, amuſed, and diverted from his Soveraign good: And ſince that time, I could make no more ſtand to conſider any of theſe things; and if I did it, I ſhould reproach my ſelf for it; as no ſooner ſeeing them in Churches, or elſewhere, but this is preſently put upon my ſpirit,</hi> The original is nothing, the copy and the image is yet leſs, each thing is vain, except the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſelves about God alone.</p>
                  <p>And in truth, a Chriſtian who is nurtured and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated for ſo great things, as the poſſeſſion of God, and Eternal glory, ought to undervalue all that which is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115611:54"/>is here below, yea, how reſplendent ſoever; with much more reaſon, than a great King will reject a boot of hay-ropes (to which hay indeed, the Prophet compares all worldly glories) in compariſon of his Crown and Kingdom. This was the cauſe that employed this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, to animate a Lady to the vilifying of the world, by writing to her in this manner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſhall tell you, that ſeeing we are not Chriſtians, but by the tie, the dependence, and the life, we have of Jeſus Chriſt, I wonder how it comes about, that a thing ſo little as man, drawn out of nothing in his firſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, infected with his firſt Parents ſin, and the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own, raiſed to ſo high a degree of honour, as the alliance of Chriſtianity gives him, in being one onely Christ with the Son of God, in being his brother, and a co-heir with him in the life to come: I wonder, I ſay, how, after ſuch admirable Prerogatives, man can eſteem the world, and make any account of its vanities? Shall he have his heart here, and be a man of this world, after theſe conſiderations? The things of the earth, whereof death alſo will quite strip us, and for ever, ſhall they fill our hearts, in that little time we have to be here, to work out our ſalvation, to obtain the treaſures prepared for us, and to render thanks to God for his mercies? ſhould we not make appear to God and men, a faith that is altogether lively, in quitting freely the things of this world, its honours, falſe, or at leaſt not profitable, its eſtabliſhments periſhable, its opinions extravagant, and all that, which will paſs away like a dream? even as we ſee our great Grandfathers are gone, and there is no more memory of them, their riſings and ſettings, their contentments and diſpleaſures, which did ſtick ſo cloſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115611:54"/>to their hearts, and which they had ſo much pain to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to the Law of Jeſus Chriſt, and to the genius of their times, all this is vaniſhed away. Is it not true, that we have cauſe to think them to have been out of their wits, if they conſidered any other thing but God in their ways? The ſame thing will happen to us, each thing will paſs away, and God alone will abide: O how good it is to be faſtned to him alone?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He encourageth the ſame Lady in another Letter, thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Courage, all is well, we muſt dye to the world, and ſearch out the obſtacles, that it brings to our perfections, to condemn them; and to live in the world (in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſenſe) as not living there at all; poſſeſſing it, as not poſſeſſing it all: Let us drive ſtoutly out of our mindes the complacence and affection to our brave houſes; let us ruine the delights of our gardens, let us burn our Groves, let us baniſh theſe vain images which we have of our children, hiding ſecretly in the love of them, that which is but indeed our own ſelf-love (though we ſeem dead to it) and it makes us deſire, eſteem, and approve in their perſons, that which we condemn in our ſelves; to wit, the luſter and glittering of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I know there is a difference of conditions, but all ought to reject theſe entailments (as men account them) upon great birth and noble blood: I mean, theſe principles of aſpiring to the higheſt, and entertaining no ſufferings: ſuch principles as theſe, our children carry from that birth we give them; but it behoveth, that the ſecond birth, which we procure them from Jeſus Chriſt, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair theſe diſorders: Let us take from them this vanity
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115611:55"/>of minde, all theſe ſtately demeanors, and the examples of theſe Grandees in ſtory, whoſe puniſhments are as eminent in hell, as their preſumption hath been glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the earth; for otherwiſe it will be found, we ſhall conduct them to no better end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another Letter he explains to her, what he had ſaid concerning her Houſes and Gardens, and which without this Explication, would ſeem to be very harſh:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My deſign, ſaid he, was not that you ſhould demoliſh your walls, and let run into a rude wilderneſs your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, to be more at liberty for God: I underſtand my ſpeech, of the diſingagements and the ruines which muſt be made in our mindes, and not be executed on things inſenſible, and which have no worth in them, but in form. When I ſay, we muſt ſet all on fire, my thoughts were of following that admirable ſpirit of the Apoſtle, who would that we have poverty among our riches, and diveſtment in the midſt of our poſſeſſions; he means, that our ſpirits be truly purified and ſeparated from the creatures, which we really make our ſolace; becauſe a Chriſtian that tends to perfection, doth himſelf great wrong in dwelling upon theſe amuſements, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in his heart other inclinations than thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaw all the world without deſtroying it; but withal, without applying himſelf to it; the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of his Father, and his glory, was his life; the windings of rivers, and the ornaments of fields, were to him but things of feeble conſideration, and not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of imployment. Hither it is that I would have one come, and deſire no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:115611:55"/>
                  <p>It is, in effect, thus, That we muſt contemn the world; whereunto God carries us, and to bring us thither more efficaciouſly, he permits by turns, and often that we receive therein diſgraces, and meet with pain and trouble; as when a man ſets thorns in a way, to make men take another: The which Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> knowing very well, ſee what he writes thereof to a certain perſon:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God hath his ends through all theſe contrarieties; which is, that thoſe that are his, ſhould be yet more his, in affiance, in recumbency, in life, and in all: The bruite of the world, and its turning upſide down, are advantageous, to make known its ſpirit, its confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, its vanity, to them that are not of it; and who being in the ſpirit of death, wait for nothing more there, than for death; bringing forth in the mean while, the effects of life eternal, which is a kinde of advancement out of mortality, whilſt we are in it.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. 5. <hi>Of his Patience.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>QUeſtionleſs the humble man is patient, becauſe he eſteems himſelf worthy of the evil he ſuffers, and of much more alſo: And if we will ſearch into the true cauſe of our impatiences, and drive up to the ſpring head, we ſhall finde it to be our pride, and the eſteem of our ſelves. Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> being moſt humble, as we have ſeen, was alſo by conſequence moſt patient, as this Chapter is going to relate.</p>
                  <p>And now at firſt, when I am thinking of it, there comes into my minde, the deſcription that <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes of patience, repreſenting her with a viſage ſweet and calm, a forehead ſerene, without all ſhew of frowning or ſadneſs; a carriage always equal, few words, and a contenance ſuch as one ſees in perſons innocent and aſſured: Now they that knew him, will ſay, that this is the very portraicture of him in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive colours, as being the very image of Patience to the life, having all theſe qualities in a very high degree. He had alſo many other interior qualities neceſſary for this vertue; for thoſe now mentioned concern one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the exterior.</p>
                  <p>Perſons that had lived a very long time with him, and had ſtudied with care all his actions, never heard him complain for any thing whatſoever, neither for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115611:56"/>ſickneſs, nor loſs, nor in any other occaſion of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but they always obſerved in him, a conſtancy immoveable, a patience invincible, and which paſſed often into joy, with an eveneſs ſo great and ſo marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that he ſpake not one word higher than another, nor uſed any geſture, which might argue a ſpirit over eager or forward.</p>
                  <p>In his ſecond journey to <hi>Dijon</hi> (which he made with the Lady his wife, and the late deceaſed Counteſs of <hi>Chaſtres</hi>) the ſecond or third day, he was aſſaulted with a violent Rheumatiſm, which put him into pain all over his body, and being to lie down in bed, as need was, he went thither quite ſtooping, ſupported by a ſtaff, and by a perſon that led him: In this voyage he ſuffered extream pain, without ſaying ever a word, or making the leaſt complaint: Theſe Ladies perceived it, ſeeing him grow wan and pale as a clout, and afterwards in a moment all on fire, and although they told him, that ſurely he was very ill, he anſwered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, nor embraced the eaſement of talking of his grief, which naturally the ſick deſires; but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them with diſcourſes of the exceſſive dolours of Jeſus Chriſt, and what a favour it was from God, when a ſoul ſuffers for him; but in terms ſo full of ſweetneſs, and with ſo much of love and zeal, that the company was affected with great devotion in hearing him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Ladies not able to get out of him, what his pain was, and deſiring much to know it, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the Prioreſs of the Carmelites of <hi>Dijon</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſhe might have more power with him than themſelves) to ask him concerning it; which ſhe did: To whom he anſwered plainly,</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:115611:57"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My pains are great, even to crying out, and ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but although I feel them in the greateſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet through Gods grace, I yeild not up my ſelf to them, but to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He told her moreover, that being led into his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Citry,</hi> and ſet down upon a bench, by reaſon of his ſickneſs, the bench broke, without any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at all to him, that ſuch a thing could happen, and that he believed, the evil ſpirit had broken it, to move him to impatience, making him to fall unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But by the mercy of God, I was no more moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>than you ſee me now, although the pains that ſurprized me were very ſharp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man had need have great command of himſelf, and be very patient, to be able in like occaſions, not to be moved at all, and to keep himſelf in the ſame poſture of ſpirit, as if nothing had hapned.</p>
                  <p>I had the favour, ſaid this good Mother, to be with him about two hours, while he was exerciſed with theſe great torments, which I ſaw him bear with ſo much calmneſs and modeſty, without ſtirring at all, and talking juſt no otherwiſe, than if in going out of the Speak-houſe, he had been in perfect health, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, God knows, he was in great pain, reſting upon a ſtaff, and going twofold: All our Nunnery was much afflicted to ſee him in this condition; and it was the motion of ſome, to make a vow for his health to the Lady of Grace (whoſe Image here they honour) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115611:57"/>that the Mother of God, would not deny them it, both for the veneration that this ſervant of God rendred to this Image, as alſo for the great obligations our houſe had to him. The whole Society made the vow upon the day of her Nativity, after Maſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> was preſent, but, by no means, being able to kneel. The vow was accepted; for after that night he came without ſtaff into the Parlour, and a few days after, he could kneel down, and was grown well within the nine days of the Vows continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: They keep the ſtaff in the Covent, in devotion and memory of this grace; and he in acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the benefit received, ſent a Heart of Chryſtal in a Caſe of Gold, to hang about the Neck of the Virgin.</p>
                  <p>Having loſt a Son whom he dearly loved, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured this ſharp affliction without ſaying a word, ſave onely in teſtifying his perfect ſubmiſſion to the orders of God, and with ſo much patience, as might juſtly render it an action Heroical.</p>
                  <p>Often had he great exerciſe of patience in the works of Charity, which he rendred to his Neighbour; not onely enduring hunger, thirſt, heat, cold, wet, wearineſs of body, and other outward pains, inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable attendants on the employments he had, but alſo contempts and reproaches.</p>
                  <p>While he was employed on certain ſet days in an Hoſpital, in catechiſing poor Paſſengers, a certain man that was there ſetled, was offended at this action of humility and ſignal charity, in a perſon of that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, looking upon it, as an encroachment and intruſion upon his office, and came to finde him out, as he was in the midſt of the poor, inſtructing them, and gave
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115611:58"/>him, in their hearing, divers injurious and offenſive words, to diſcourage him from coming again. Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> ſeeing this man take on ſo againſt him, heard him without being moved, and patiently enduring his contempt and outrages; after all, makes anſwer, with much humility and reſpect, that he deſired to teach thoſe poor people, which he ſaw to have great need of it; that he was not willing to come on any ſuch days, as he would take, but ſeeieg that he would not be at the pains himſelf, he prayed him not to hinder a good work: This did not ſatisfie the man at all, but he comes four days together into the Hoſpital, to drive out Monſieur <hi>de Renty,</hi> as ſoon as he began the Catechiſm, doing it inſtead of him; which this moſt courteous Nobleman endured all the time, with an admirable patience.</p>
                  <p>He practiſed this vertue with great care and conduct, through all the things of this life, whereof there is not any but will give occaſion of patience; ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hapned, general or particular, though it check'd and juſtled his nature, his body, ſpirit, judgement, will, inclinations, deſires, deſigns, and thoſe of the beſt ſort, every thing that concerned him in what way ſoever, he endeavoured to improve it towards grace and perfection, and poſſeſs his ſoul in patience and tranquility, receiving and ſuffering all without any alteration, or being either exalted or dejected by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Praying to God before the Holy Sacrament (ſaith he, in a memorial under his own hand) a poor man came to me to beg an Alms, at that time I applied my ſelf to recollection, when men uſe to receive ſuch interruptions
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115611:58"/>with ſome contradiction; and the word it ſelf implies as much; for we call it,</hi> The importunity of the poor: <hi>It was given mee in this inſtant to underſtand, that if we were well enlightned, we ſhould not count our ſelves importuned, or hindred by any perſon or thing; becauſe we ſhould regard the order of God, conducting all things to our advantage; that as it behoves us to ſuffer with patience the diſtractions interior, ſo ought we to endure the exterior, and that the vexation, unquietneſs, and impatience, which theſe little accidents cauſe in us, come from our ignorance and immortification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is not for all that though, but we may ſhun the occaſions of trouble: but when they come, we muſt look upon them as ordered by God, receive and bear them with all ſweetneſs, humility and reverence; and ſo though they come and interrupt us, the order of God is not interrupted in us, but we follow it; and this indeed is the treaſure, and the great ſecret of the life ſpiritual, and (I may ſo ſay) a Paradiſe upon earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>True it is, that nothing troubles us, but through our own fault, and all the vexations which we either reſent within, or vent outwardly, when any one croſſes, hinders or diverts us from doing any thing, have no other ſource, but the diſorders of our too much engaged ſpirits. And for the better ſtifling of theſe paſſionate riſings, and keeping our hearts in peace, we muſt mark this well: that if one hinders us from doing one good work, he thereby gives us the means of practiſing another. A man (ſuppoſe) draws you away from prayer, or from reading, hinders you from the executing of ſome good deſign you had for your neighbour: It is true, but he puts you withal into a condition of exerciſing patience, which in this conjuncture, will be better, more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115611:59"/>to God, and more efficacious to perfectionate you, than all thoſe other actions; for in them there was found your own will, but in theſe, there comes in a Self-abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, wherein conſiſts your perfection: for the fulneſs of God is not; but in the emptineſs of the creature.</hi>

                     <p>THis great patience in Monſieur <hi>de Renty,</hi> did flow from the high eſteem he made of ſufferings, which if well underſtood, are no other than well-ſprings of life eternal, than mines of gold, celeſtial riches, than participations of the Croſs of our Lord; which Croſs God hath appointed the cauſe of our happineſs, and of all the good that we ſhall ever poſſeſs; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whereunto every one muſt have ſome ligament or nail to affix him, who will be ſaved.</p>
                     <p>To one that ſuffered, he wrote thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God faſhions you for himſelf, uniting you here below to Jeſus Chriſts ſufferings: Ah! what a great favour is it! and greater than we are aware of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to another:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What a bleſsing is it that God makes you ſuffer? whilſt the world laughs! if thoſe of the contrary part had (as you have) their eyes open, they would ſee a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing wonder; your ſelf to laugh in ſuffering, and

                        </gap> 30 of <hi>April,</hi> he wrote thus to his Director:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have always before my eyes my feebleneſs, and that little which I render to God for his favours, which keeps me in abnegation; but yet with great affiance, which carries me to love, to docility, and to obedience; but love and obedience that inflames me more to ſuffer with our Lord: This is my greateſt longing and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115611:60"/>becauſe in every other thing we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers from God; but in this here (although we receive the grace to ſuffer) yet the ſuffering is that which we can properly give to God, and is the greateſt gage and proof of our love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But it is not for all this reaſoning aforeſaid; that I ſhould chuſe and bring ſufferings upon me, but I feel my ſelf inwardly inclined towards it, and stay there. It is about a fortnight ſince that I had ſuch a kinde of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, and ſuch a love to our Lord, ſuffering and offering himſelf to God his Father, and knitting us to himſelf to be but one and the ſame ſacrifice, that I felt my ſelf in an instant, and during that inſtant, glued to the Croſs by ſuch an alliance of love, as is inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and whereof the vertve continues with me to this preſent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a Memorial that he gave him the year, 1648. in <hi>Lent,</hi> concerning his diſpoſitions: he ſaid,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is come into my minde, that the way to make me keep a hard</hi> Lent, <hi>would be to ſet me at a good Table, and oblige me to make good chear, to caſt me among the brave companions of the world, to prattle and laugh, and to lead me into walks, and meetings of young gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry; for this would be to me a little hell; yea (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking of the ſin that might be there) the very thought of it, makes me tremble; for it is true, that Solitude, faſtings, and other things, which are called Penances, are my attractives or allurements.</hi>

                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:115611:60"/>
                     <p>And afterward, he very wiſely addes:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Although I have this feeling, I ceaſe not to know what I am, and in all my inclinations and deſires, I take heed not to beg to ſuffer the leaſt thing; and when I happen to do it of my ſelf, I revoke it afterwards, as having done fooliſhly: I have too much experienc of my weakneſs; I give my ſelf onely to my God, for every thing he deſires of me, from the top of heaven, even to the bottom of hell; by his order I will all, with him I can do all, and that which is ordered by him, is always accompanied with his grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This great ſervant of God inlightned and touched with theſe illuminations and contemplations, ſtirred up to patience all thoſe that he dealt with, and perſwaded them to knit and unite themſelves intimately to our Lord ſuffering and crucified. He wrote thus to one afflicted:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I beſeech our Lord to fortifie you more and more with his graces; and that the more he imprints in you the characters of his paſsion, the more he may make you grow in the holy uſe of your ſuffering to accompliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in your perſon, what S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> Abſit mihi gloriari niſi in cruce Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti, [God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing, ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.] <hi>I aſſure you, it is a great ſhame to a Chriſtian, to paſs his days in this world, more at eaſe, than Jeſus Chriſt here paſſed his. Ah! had we but a little faith, what repoſe could we take out of the Croſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But if all have not this grace, how much ought they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115611:61"/>to whom it is given, to cheriſh it, ſeeing it is a mark of the high degree of glory, that they one day ſhall poſſeſs: for who doubts, but that in proportion, as we ſhall be conformed to the death of the Son of God, and to his pain, we ſhall in the ſame degree, be to his glory, and receive the recompence thereof in bliſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And afterwards teaching him the way of well-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he gives him this advice, which contains all the ſecret.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the beauty of ſuffering is in the interior, in the holy diſpoſitions of Jeſus Chriſt, who is (and it is a thing to be well marked, and always ſtudied) as well the model as the head of all ſufferers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to another, out of the ſame thought, he ſaid:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is a great favour to ſuffer: All the worlds deceiv'd, ſuppoſing this a common favour, it is very rare: It is true, we may ſay that many ſuffer, but of them there are very few, that ſuffer in the diſpoſitions of Jeſus Chriſt: very few, which ſuffer with a perfect reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to what God ordains concerning them; very few, without ſome inquietude, and dwelling in their thoughts upon their preſſures; few that give up all events to the conduct of God, without making reflection thereupon, for to employ themſelves entirely in his praiſe, and to give way, by our acquieſcence and ſubmiſſion, for him to exerciſe all his rights and power over us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:115611:61"/>
                     <p>He fortifies and encourageth, in this ſort, a Lady much in pain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Few underſtand the ſecret of Chriſtianity; many call themſelves Chriſtians, and few have the ſpirit thereof: many in their prayers and ordinary affairs, look up to heaven; but in their important actions, they are children of nature, not looking, but on the earth, whence if they life up their eyes to heaven, it is but to complain, and pray him to condeſcend to their deſires, and not to ſhew their acceptance of his: They give ſome ſmall things to God, but will retain thoſe which their love ties them to; and if he ſeparate them from them, it is a violence, and a diſmembring which he muſt make, and to which they cannot conſent; as though the life of Chriſtians were not a life of ſacrifice, and an Imitation of Jeſus Chriſt crucified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God, who knows our wretchedneſs, takes from us, for our greater good, the cauſe of our evil, a Parent, a Childe, a Husband, that he may by another evil, which is affliction, draw us to himſelf, and make us ſee, that all theſe alliances; and connexions to whatſoever it be, that ſeparates us from him, are ſo many obſtacles, of ſo great importance, that one day, in the face of all the creatures, we ſhall confeſs, that the greateſt mercy that he ever did us, was to free us of them: It is a wormwood-bitter onely to the mouth and taſte, but whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the heart; kills the old</hi> Adam, <hi>to make alive in us Jeſus Chriſt; it is a great winter, which is the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the beauty of the other ſeaſons: But we muſt beware, that what is given us out of favour, we take not as a thing by chance, or a misfortune; for this would
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115611:62"/>be to turn the remedy into poyſon, and to receive the grace to chaſe it away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let us enter into the holy and adorable diſpoſition, which was always in Jeſus Chriſt, to ſuffer willingly, for the honour of his Father, and for our ſalvation. Is not this a ſtrange thing, that men knowing, that the way which Jeſus Chriſt paſt thorow to glory, was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, pain, and the croſs, yet they that call themſelves his diſciples and followers, ſhould expect, and beg of him for themſelves another way to walk in? Is the Diſciple greater than the Maſter? and if the head willingly paſſed that way, what remains for the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? ought not they to follow him? Let us therefore go after him, and ſuffer after his model: Bleſſed be ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the loſs of honour, of riches, of goods, and of the neareſt things, and the ſeparation from all creatures, which hold us bowed towards the earth, if it ſet us ſtreight, and make us lift up our eyes to heaven, and to enter into the deſigns that God hath over us: Bleſſed be the plague, the war, and the famine, and generally all the ſcourges of God, which produce theſe effects of grace and ſalvation in us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conclude in theſe words which he ſent to another perſon:</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>THe greateſt exerciſe of patience that Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> ever had in all his life, was that which was given him by the Lady his Mother; who, whether ſhe were angry, that he was ſo forward in devotion, always among Priſons, always among Hoſpitals, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways employed in actions low and abject, in the eyes of the world, far beneath, as ſhe thought, his birth, and that ſhe ſhould have been glad to ſee him in gliſtering and glorious employments, wherein his Anceſtors had appeared: or were it, that ſhe was puſhed thereto by ſome evil counſel, or otherways. So it was, that ſhe gave him (and for a long time) matter of ſuffering; and one may ſay, that as ſhe contributed much to the making him man, ſo ſhe contributed much to the making him a perfect Chriſtian. The caſe was thus, The Lady pretending to great rights in the goods which her deceaſed husband had bequeathed to her Son, did demand the ſame of him; who with great ſubmiſſion and reſpect, gave her all that he believed was her due, and over and above; but ſhe not content therewith, demanded more; which her ſon finding, by advice of learned Counſel, that it could not be done without wrong to his children, did remit the buſineſs to Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and agreed for the ſatisfaction of his mother,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115611:63"/>that ſhe ſhould choſe them all, as ſhe pleaſed, perſons of ability and honeſty, of her acquaintance, and ſuch as he knew not at all, to determine what he might give her, without prejudice to his conſcience: When they were choſen, he went to finde them out, and prayed them to content the Lady his mother in every thing, that might lawfully be done, without having regard to him, which was a requeſt altogether extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, made to Judges, by one of the parties, and which well makes appear, the affection and the honour which Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> bore to his mother, and how far he was from ſeeking his own intereſt.</p>
                     <p>The day being come wherein theſe Gentlemen were to give their ſentence: whilſt they were employed in the framing of it, the ſaid Lady was in one chamber of the houſe, and her ſon, with Madam his Lady, and a Gentlewoman, in another, where the employment of her moſt vertuous ſon was, to pray to God for a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the buſineſs, to his glory, and the procurement of peace; and for this end, he cauſed them to ſay with him ſome hymns, till the time that there was brought him the award, to ſign it; which was read to him, and which he heard with great calmneſs of ſpirit; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was not advantagious to him, and that there was a notable forfeiture on them that ſhould not ſtand to it, he ſigned it without diſpute, or endeavour, to get better terms.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, believing that his mother would be fully ſatisfied, with what had been decreed, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his lodging, he cauſed to be ſung <hi>Te Deum Laudamus,</hi> beginning it firſt himſelf, and from his heart, in way of thankſgiving for this concluſion, which he ſuppoſed would be a bond of peace between his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115611:63"/>mother and him, and a means of living happily with her, the reſt of his days: But God (to purifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine him yet more, and to lay a croſs upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which he bore divers years in a moſt holy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) permits, that the thing ſhould not take effect, according to his deſire; becauſe his mother not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting herſelf ſatisfied with this advantage which theſe Arbitrators had given her, found our a way to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from the award, yet without being obliged to pay the forfeiture for refuſal, and to ſue him for her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended right, at the Parliament of <hi>Dijon.</hi> Her ſon did all that was poſſible for him, to make her alter this deſign, and to ſweeten her heart towards him; and; for the bringing of this about, he had recourſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies ſupernatural; he made long prayers, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penance thereto; he faſted with extraordinary ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and macerated his body with great auſterities, hoping God would have regard to theſe actions, and to the ſincerity of his intentions.</p>
                     <p>After he had thus prepared himſelf for ſome time, he went to his mother, and caſt himſelf on his knees before her, with a reverence, humility, and ſubmiſſion able to mollifie the moſt obdurate heart; the which thing he did, not for once onely, but often, and with abundance of tears; and begg'd of her with the moſt efficacious words that he could make uſe of; that ſhe would be pleaſed to take him and all his family unto her, and entertain them as ſhe thought meet; and after that, ſhe might diſpoſe as ſhe pleaſed of all the goods that his father had left him.</p>
                     <p>She would not conſent to this humble and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble requeſt, but perſiſted in her reſolution to go to <hi>Dijon,</hi> and ſue him there; which he perceiving, though
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115611:64"/>he might, by an expedient preſented to him, have croſt that, and never ſtirr'd out of <hi>Paris,</hi> yet out of reſpect to her, and to comply with her in this buſineſs, would not make uſe of it, but determined to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and did ſo.</p>
                     <p>And this he did, out of a diſpoſition to confuſion and debaſement; which indeed he met with to purpoſe, finding mens minds prejudiced againſt him, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of great injury, for one that made profeſſion of ſo high piety, to deal ſo with his mother, which he endured, that he might be partaker of the reproaches, and honour the ſelf-abaſement of the ſon of God, who came into the world for our ſakes, in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, and appeared as a criminal, although he was very Innocence it ſelf: And ſo paſſed he here, for a guilty perſon in this buſineſs, though he was not at all in fault; but on the contrary, exerciſed therein, actions of Heroical vertue, of which you ſhall now ſee ſome of them.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of piety, and Superiour of a Religious Houſe, acquainting him with all the evil and ſtrange reports which were ſpread abroad of him in <hi>Dijon,</hi> where none were to juſtifie him, being a meer ſtranger there; he heard it all without any ſign of paſſion, but with admirable calmneſs, elevated himſelf to God in heart and words, and humbled himſelf before him; whereat ſhe was much edified. She demanded, after this, whether there had been put in, any injurious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers againſt his mother, as was reported. He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, No; though Proctors and Advocates ſometimes ſay more than one would have them, yet that he had ſeen all the writings, and found them all drawn with that reſpect, which was due to a mother.</p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:115611:64"/>
                     <p>She ask'd him alſo, if he was not afflicted at her manner of proceeding againſt him, ſeeming very harſh and extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>He ſaid, <hi>No, becauſe I ſo much adore the order of God over me, that I cannot be afflicted at that which he permits to befal me: I am a great ſinner, and therefore not onely my mother, but all the world have juſt cauſe to take part againſt me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In brief, he was never heard to make any complaint of hard uſage from his mother, but continually laid the blame upon his ſins.</p>
                     <p>The ſame perſon addes in a Memorial, how that divers ſeeking out ways of accord, had the greateſt trouble in the world to make her joyn in it, every day inventing new difficulties, even when it was believed that all had been given her, whatſoever ſhe deſired; and that in the midſt of theſe delays from day to day, herſelf ſaid to Monſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> Sir, I ſhall willingly ſay the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> when once I hear your buſineſs end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And one day, when they believed Articles would have been ſigned, without retracting (on which day notwithſtanding, all was broken off) he came with a pleaſant countenance, to deſire her to ſay the <hi>Te Demm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is now the time to ſay the</hi> Te Deum, <hi>ſaid he, ſince you had the goodneſs to promiſe it: And may I be ſo bold, as to deſire to ſay it with you? O what a great and wiſe God have we! who knows well how to do all things as they ought, and when they ought; not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115611:65"/>to our precipitations, but to his order, which is our Sanctification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereupon he ſaid the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> with a ſpirit ſo elevated to God, as gave ſufficient evidence of his being wholly filled with him.</p>
                     <p>And afterward ſaid:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Its well, though nothing be done, yet it was very meet to ſay the</hi> Te Deum, <hi>to render thanks to God, for that he hath done his own will, and not that of a finner, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be heard or regarded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This action filled me with admiration (wrote this perſon) and ſo much the more, becauſe the buſineſs was believed to be broken, without hopes of making up again. And I no leſs admired his ſilence, in a buſineſs that touched him ſo near, in that he never ſpake word to me of it, nor of his mother; ſave onely to deſire, that they both might be recommended to God: And from the beginning, that I had the honour to ſpeak to him, when I gave him notice of the offers that divers perſons had made us to ferve him, he thankt me moſt heartily for my good will (with great acknowledgment towards thoſe perſons) and without ſpeaking any more thereof, he fell upon diſcourſing of God; never after opening his mouth about that buſineſs, which evidenced a wonderful diſengagement, and death to every thing, though of never ſo ſenſible an intereſt.</p>
                     <p>There paſt alſo many other things at <hi>Dijon,</hi> and ſince at <hi>Paris,</hi> during theſe differences, even to the death of his mother; yea, and after, which required an extream deal of patience, and which he practiſed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115611:65"/>in an Heroical perfection, even to the aſtoniſhment of thoſe who were acquainted with the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>But it is enough, of this matter we have ſpoken ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, and I doubt not, Monſieur <hi>de Renty,</hi> who is now (as his eminent vertues give us ſufficient ground to believe) in the place of perfect Charity, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of my deſign, in not ſpeaking more thereof, and of uſing reſervedneſs towards that Lady, to whom all his life, he bore ſo much love and reſpect.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. 6. <hi>Of his Mortification.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHat we have ſpoken hitherto in this Second Part of the Auſterities, of the Poverty, Humility and Patience of Monſieur <hi>de Renty,</hi> makes appear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, to what height he was mortified, and that he was a true grain of that myſterious wheat mentioned by our Saviour, which by dying, brings forth much fruit; yet beſides all this, we ſhall touch here ſome other effects of his Mortification.</p>
                  <p>The grand ſecret of Chriſtian-life, conſiſts in the deſtruction of what our nature hath in it vitious, the better to give way to grace, in crucifying the old man, that Jeſus Chriſt may live there, who hath taught us, that this is not acquired but by continual Mortification; and to that end, hath told us, that if any man doth not take up his Croſs, and that dayly, he cannot be my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:115611:66"/>
                  <p>This excellent Scholar of that great Maſter, having well learnt his leſſon, employed all his care in the beginning of his Converſion, to mortifie himſelf in every thing, to ſubdue his paſſions, to regulate his motions Interior and Exterior, to annihilate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and to dye to all the inclinations of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, with ſo great faithfulneſs and conſtancy, that as ſoon as he perceived her to carry him to any thing with ſome imperfection, and that his natural will enclined one way, he did the quite contrary: And he told an intimate perſon, that having undertaken the endeavour to oppoſe his nature in each thing, by the grace of God he had always ſurmounted it; inſomuch, that in all things he proceeded with a ſpirit of death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſacrifice, making no further uſe of his paſſions, ſenſes, nor of any thing in him, but with an eye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways open, to hinder the operations of malign nature, and whatever ſhe brought thereto of her own, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the conduct of our Lord, ſaying, that a man muſt diſengage himſelf from himſelf, and every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God onely may be his object.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly he performed it exactly; for when in his ſickneſs he endured moſt ſharp pains, he was ſo taken up with God, and abſtracted from them, that he thought not of them. It was impoſſible to finde a man more reſerved, in ſpeaking of that which troubled him than he: For as he knew, that nature is apt to ſeek and comfort it ſelf, in diſcourſing of that which hurts her, ſo he deprived her of that ſatisfaction and content, lifting up in the mean while his heart to God, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him his pain, without otherwiſe dwelling upon it; being glad that Gods work went forward, that the body of ſin was in deſtroying, &amp; his ſacrifice advancing.</p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:115611:66"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that is baptized (ſaid he) ought to be dead in Jeſus Chriſt, and to lead a life of ſuffering, and in this ſuffering, of application to God, let us march on to our end, which is ſacrifice in each thing, in the manner that God will have it, upon the bottom of obedience to his orders, and of the annthilation of our ſelves, in the imitation, and by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt: Let us be ſo many Victims, entertained, and taken up with theſe Interior diſpoſitions and ſentiments, that Chriſt had from his conception to his death, and to the laſt period of his offering up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it was, he had often in his mouth theſe words, <hi>Sacrifice, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> minding to ſay thus, that we ought to ſtudy and enforce our ſelves to dye in each thing to our ſelves; and for the attaining thereof, to ſacrifice to God our ſpirit, our judgement, our will, our thoughts, our affections, our deſires, our paſſions, and all in the union, and after the manner of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In theſe apprehenſions, he wrote to a perſon, that he had great devotion to theſe words, which the 24 Elders ſang in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to the Lamb, which is our Lord, proſtrate before his Throne, <hi>Thou haſt made us Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign upon the earth:</hi> In that this divine Lamb cauſeth that God eſtabliſheth his Kingdom in us, by reigning in our ſouls, and in our bodies, by his grace, that we are Prieſts, to offer up our ſelves to him in ſacrifice; and that by this means we ſhall reign for ever with him, in the land of the living: So that this excellent man, in all occaſions where it behoved him to deny ſomething to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115611:67"/>his nature, and to dye to himſelf, caſt his eyes upon this eſtate of ſacrifice and of victime, to offer up himſelf to the glory of God, by the pattern of his Son our Lord.</p>
                  <p>This great and continual care which he had to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie himſelf in each thing, brought about, that he had ſo tamed his paſſions, ſo regulated the motions of his ſoul and body, ſo changed his inclinations, and ſubdued his nature, that at length he came to ſuch a point of Mortification, paſſive, and of death, that he felt no more in the ſpirit any oppoſition to any thing painful, and was not mortified with any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: From thence came it, that writing to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, concerning his diſpoſition, he ſaid, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not that which they call Mortification; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that where there is no contradiction nor reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, there is no mortification; and when there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel any thing of a much mortifying nature, and would have touch'd him much, if he had been as yet alive to himſelf, if any familiar perſon ſpake to him of the pain thereof; he ſaid ſmiling, that the thing went well, and that we muſt gain upon our ſelves, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may mortifie us any more, and that we be, as it were, inſenſible to each thing.</p>
                  <p>He came to this paſs, not by the goodneſs of his nature, nor by a kinde of ſtupid indifferency, which ſometimes is found in certain ſleepy ſpirits; but by his labour and vertue, which had made this bleſſed work in him, and had changed his nature; for they that knew his youth, report, that naturally he was of a ſwelling, haſty, haughty, and jeering diſpoſition; which he had ſo corrected, or to ſay better, annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that in truth it was admirable, inſomuch that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115611:67"/>he was become moderate, ſtaid, patient, humble, and reſpectful, in a degree of conſummate perfection: So that if we conſider him well, a man may ſay, that he was of a diſpoſition quite contrary, and diametrically oppoſite, to that which he brought from his mothers womb; teaching us by an example, ſo aſſured and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, that a man may prevail much over himſelf, if he endeavour it ſincerely, and that, whatever vice he hath, he may at laſt rid himſelf of it, if he force himſelf; according to thoſe words of our Lord, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, he recommended in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner this holy courage, and the neceſſity of ſelf-enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as being that by which we may meaſure what profit we have made in true vertue, and a means alſo abſolutely neceſſary for the gaining of perfection. He wrote to a perſon that practiſed devotion, thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O how much to be feared is it, that we cheat our ſelves with the name and the appearances of devotion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying much on our exerciſes of piety; which, it may be, are barely performed, and in ſpeculation onely, never coming to the practiſe, nor to the conqueſt over our ſelves. In the morning we worſhip Jeſus Chriſt, as our Maſter and Director, and yet our life all the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, is not directed by him; we look upon him as our pattern, and imitate him not; we take him for our rule and guide of our affections, and yet we do not ſacrifice to him our appetites; we make him the model of our converſation, which yet is never the more holy; we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him to labour and get above our ſelves, but its no more than in imagination. The truth is, that if we
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115611:68"/>know not our devotion, rather by the violence and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement we make upon our ſelves, and the amendment of our manners, than by the multiplication and ſimple uſage of ſpiritual exerciſes, it is to be feared they will be rather practiſes of Condemnation, than of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For after all to what purpoſe all this, if the work follow not? if we change not our ſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy not that which is vitious in our nature? It is no otherwiſe, but as if a builder ſhould pile together many materials towards making of a brave Edifice, and yet never begin it. And yet we ſee the work of Jeſus Chriſt is almost reduced to this paſs, amongſt the ſpiritual perſons of theſe times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaid to another, that the love which a Chriſtian ſoul was obliged to bear to he vertues which Jeſus Chriſt hath taught us, ought not to end in the ſimple ſentiments of eſteem and reſpect toward them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſouls of the common ſort are eaſily perſwaded, that they have done their duty; but therein they deceive themſelves, for that our Lords will is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they make a further entry into the ſolidity of his Divine practiſes, ſpecially in Mortification; Patience, Poverty, and Renouncement of our ſelves; and that is the cauſe why there are ſo few ſouls truly Chriſtian, and ſolidly ſpiritual; yea, even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times amongſt the Religious, was this, that men contented themſelves to make a ſtand at this firſt ſtep.</p>
                  <p>I will end this Chapter, and this Second Part, with a Letter which he writ to his Director, who had thought it fit for him to viſit a perſon that had great need of ſuccour and inſtruction for ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115611:68"/>diſpoſitions, which he performed with much ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and benediction.</p>
                  <p>This Letter dated the 14 of <hi>May,</hi> in the year, 1647. will make us well ſee the great diſengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had from himſelf, and his perfect Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification attended with gifts ineſtimable, and his great light whereby he clears and explicates matters of great ſubtilty: The tenour is as followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the perſon whom you know, and the viſit I made him, it is God and your direction that hath done all: I am ſo much afraid to mingle therein any thing of mine, that going to the place where he is, yet I perceive I ſhall not viſit him, without a new order from you, or that he much deſire it: I have not ſince that time, ſo much as ſent any commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, conſidering with my ſelf, that we muſt keep the man reſerved, and in great ſobriety: And I thought it fit to caſt all this upon you, as my guide in the buſineſs. Ha Father, the great imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſouls, is the not waiting enough on God, the natural diſpoſition strugling, and not brought into ſubjection, comes in with fine pretexts, and thinks to do wonders; and in the mean while it is that which ſullies the purity of the Soul, that which troubles its ſilence, and turns aſide its ſight from Faith, from Affiance, and from Love; whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that the Father of Lights expreſſeth not in us his Eternall Word, nor produceth in us his Spirit of Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Incarnation hath merited all, not onely for the abolition of our faults, but alſo for all the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of grace, whereunto Jeſus Chriſt is minded to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate us; of which this is the principal (and was
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115611:69"/>in him ſo far as he was man) to do nothing our ſelves, but to ſpeak and act according as we receive, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we alone are not to do the work; but that the holy Spirit, which is the Spirit of Jeſus, and which governed him in all his ways, is within us; which would stamp upon us his impreſſions, and give us the life, the life real and experimental of our faith, if ballaſted and held back by patience, we would but wait his operation. This is it in which I feel my infirmity, and yet whither I finde a great attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive: I ſee that which I cannot utter, for I poſſeſs that which I cannot expreſs: And the cauſe (Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) why I am ſo brief, comes both from the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of my natural diſpoſition, and from ignorance, as alſo from a great largeneſs of the Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which works in me that which I cannot utter. The effect of this is, a fulneſs and a ſatiating of the truth and clearneſs of the magnificence of God, of the greatneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the riches which we have in him; of the moſt Holy Virgin, and of the Saints; one ſees here all praiſe and adoration, and comtemplates them within. I tell you here of many things me ſeems, and yet all this is done with one draught ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſo ſtrong in the ſuperiour part of the Spirit, that I am nothing diverted from it by any exteriour employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I ſee all, I underſtand all, and I do (though it be ill) all, that I have to do. This is that I preſent you with, to receive therein from you inſtruction and correction.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have obſerved in the firſt part of this Hiſtory, that the grand exerciſe of Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> was, to apply and unite himſelf to our Saviour, and from that union, and his example, to derive all his vertues and good works: This was the general courſe he held in them all, to mould himſelf after him, for the compoſition of his Exterior and Interior, never taking his eye off this Divine Copy, but endeavouring to draw each line exactly, and penſil his true lineaments, making him his native and perfect Original.</p>
                  <p>This was the ſcope of all his deſigns and cares, and particularly of his charity to his neighbour; for which,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115611:70"/>he propounded our Saviour as his grand Exemplar, marking what he had done, and what he had ſuffered for men, weighing thoſe affections and tenderneſſes he bore towards them, how he ſought after, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with them; how he inſtructed, comforted, and encouraged them, ſometimes reproving, otherwhiles bearing with their infirmities, and at all times carrying them in his moſt dear embraces, and moſt intimate incloſure of his heart.</p>
                  <p>He pondered what he had delivered concerning this vertue of charity, that it was it, that he had eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the ground and perfection of his new Law; having left us this one command more expreſly, which with ſpecial propriety he had termed his own, and the execution whereof he had inforced above all other: he much thought upon it, how that this Maſter had charged us to love our neighbour, according to the model, meaſure and faſhion, that he had loved us: And finally, that he had made this vertue, and no other, the diſtinctive character betwixt ſuch as poſſeſſed his Spirit in truth, and thoſe that had it onely in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore having well-weighed theſe actions and doctrines of our Saviour, and reſolved to do his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to render himſelf a good Chriſtian, and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Imitator, he determined as far as he could, both to embrace this doctrine, and follow his actions, and to love his neighbour with the bent and ſpirit of of ſuch a divine Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Writing to Siſter <hi>Margeret,</hi> a Carmelite of <hi>Beaulne,</hi> he ſaid:</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:115611:70"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſigh after my Saviour Jeſus, deſiring to imitate and follow him whither he pleaſeth: I beſeech you by your prayers, obtain for me his Spirit, to be my life, my whole life: ſigh and groan for me after my God, that I may be wholly for him, in his Son, that I may follow him, and not live, but by his Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to another perſon, he writ thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have ſo great a view of the love, and of all the effects of the love of the moſt Holy Soul of our Lord, that this Interior, ſo full of clemency, bounty, and charity, makes me conceive far otherwiſe than ever, how that we ought to live of this Divine love, even in our deportment towards men, and how in effect, it is in him, that the whole Law is accompliſhed in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore to the ſame party, thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Since God hath manifeſted himſelf to us by his Son, and hath admitted us, through him, into his grace, and made us partakers of all his actions, both towards God and man, how can we ever quit this his dear Son? He that hath Jeſus Chriſt, hath a key which opens many doors, it diſcovers unto us large proſpects, it enricheth us with vaſt treaſures, and breaks open the priſon of mans heart, as being too ſtrait for his Immenſities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to the ſame, thus alſo:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ah, how good is that deſart! when after Baptiſm we are conducted thither with our Lord, by the Spirit of God: Thence it was that our Saviour came out to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men, to teach them, and work their ſalvation:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115611:71"/>Since therefore we, together with him, make up but one Jeſus Chriſt, as having the honour to be his members, we ſhould live his life, take on us his Spirit, and walk in his ſteps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the ground that made this perfect Diſciple apply himſelf with all his power to this admirable Charity, which we are now coming to ſpeak of at large, endeavouring in all the commerce he had with men, to unite himſelf moſt intimately to our Saviour, rendring himſelf up as an inſtrument to be guided by his hand in the helping of others: beſeeching him to breath upon him this Spirit of Charity, recommended ſo much to us in his word, but more in his actions; and to inflame him with this divine fire, which he hath kindled in the midſt of his Church, to be wholly burnt and conſumed with it: he conſulted him in all his doubts concerning it, begging of him to inſpire, what, and how, and when, he ſhould ſpeak and act for the good of his neighbour, and that in him, and by him, theſe might all be done.</p>
                  <p>He look'd upon men, not according to their natural qualities, their beauty, nobility, riches, dignities, and wordly honors, but according to their more noble relations, and thoſe common to all; <hi>viz.</hi> as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures divine, the lively images of God, created to praiſe and love him to all eternity, as dyed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in the blood of Jeſus, brothers and co-heirs with him, his purchaſe and inheritance, bought with the price of his life, and a thouſand dolours; and who therefore muſt be infinitely dear unto him, and moſt paſſionately beloved of him.</p>
                  <p>In this capacity it was, that he beheld men, loving
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115611:71"/>and applying himſelf to their neceſſities, and he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by the purity of this conduct to ſo far perfection, that as on the one ſide he was extreamly uſeful to his neighbour, and received therein wonderful bleſſings from God; ſo on the other, this communication with them, did not diſtract, nor bring any prejudice to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but very much good. There are that adviſe them, who have to do with others in the matter of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, eſpecially with ſuch from whoſe converſe any danger may ariſe, to conſider them as bodies without ſouls, or as ſouls without bodies, and as pure ſpirits. The counſel is good, and ſome make profitable uſe of it; but Monſieur <hi>Renties</hi> view was, to look upon God and Jeſus Chriſt in every man, and to conſider, that it was they that demanded ſuccour of him, and prepared his thoughts to talk to them, and perform what was neceſſary for their ſouls and bodies, believing truly, that it was to God and Chriſt, that he rendred theſe aſſiſtances and ſervice. And this ſame thought is much to be made uſe of, that we may do good, and take no hurt from others; otherwiſe, we ſhall hazard ourſelves, and do little good, for when we proceed upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and motives of nature, the effects have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of their cauſe, proving no more but natural, or vicious, or at moſt indifferent; <hi>viz.</hi> loſs of time, light diſcourſes, amuſements, engagement of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which carry in them much of ſenſe, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate afterwards into ſomething worſe, whereby inſtead of purifying one another, a man pollutes and undoes himſelf: He that will conduct ſouls to Chriſt and God, muſt of neceſſity carry them through ſuch ways as lead thither.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. 2. <hi>His Charity to his Neighbour taken in general.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HAving a purpoſe to ſpeak of his Charity, which his man of God had towards his Neighbour, I ſhall ſpeak firſt of it in general, and ſay thus much, that it was ſo great and enlarged, that it ſeemed to have no bounds; in that he loved not onely all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and faithful people, but even all men, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting any, becauſe he beheld motives in all of them of a true charity, and ſincere love, looking upon them as creatures of God, and his chief Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for whom our Saviour became man, and laid down his life, whom he loved and deſired to ſave; theſe all he likewiſe loved, and laboured their good: <hi>Thy Commandment,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, is exceeding broad;</hi> the ſame dimenſions he preſcribed to his charity, loving the preſent and abſent, domeſticks and ſtrangers, good and bad, eſteeming all according to their degree, honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, ſpeaking well of, and doing good to all, and ill to none.</p>
                  <p>There was not any conſiderable publique good work done either at <hi>Paris,</hi> and a great way off it, wherein he had not a great ſhare. There was no undertaking there, that rended to the honour of God, or good of man, of which he was not either the Author, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter, or Finiſher, and very often all theſe together. He was one at all the meetings for Piety, and in many
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115611:72"/>as the ſoul and <hi>primum mobile,</hi> he kept correſpondence through the whole Kingdom, concerning works of charity, received from all parts letters, deſiring his advice in all difficulties that occur'd, in the erecting or advancing of Hoſpitals, Seminaries of Religion, Places of Devotion, Fraternities of Vertuous Perſons, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſociate together for the better applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their own and others ſalvation, and for the managing of all ſorts of good works.</p>
                  <p>One of good report, writ thus concerning him, from <hi>Caen;</hi> Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> was our ſupport and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuge, in the execution of all our deſigns, which related to the ſervice of God, the ſaving of ſouls, and relief of the poor and diſtreſſed: To him we wrote continually, as well for the ſettling of our Hoſpitals, and houſes for receiving of looſe women converted, as alſo for the ſuppreſſing the inſolence of ſome Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who ſhewed contempt of the bleſſed Sacrament too openly. Finally, we received counſel and ſuccour from him in all like occaſions; in which he expreſſed a great zeal for the glory of God, and extirpation of vice: Since his death, we have not met with any to whom we could have the like recourſe about the things of God.</p>
                  <p>Another from <hi>Dijon</hi> wrote thus: We cannot but acknowledge the great benefit this Province hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Monſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> wherever he came; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath wonderfully advanced all works of Piety. We may truly ſay, that his days were filled with the plenitude of God; and we believe, that he ſcarce loſt one minute of time, in which he either ſpake not, or acted not ſomething tending to his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>He applied himſelf to the neceſſities of the Engliſh,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115611:73"/>Iriſh, and captives in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and of the Miſſions into the <hi>Levant;</hi> he took very great pains for the good of the Hoſpital at <hi>Marcelles,</hi> for the relief of Galley-ſlaves, and contributed much to the advancing of the affairs of new <hi>France</hi> in <hi>America:</hi> he had a deſign likewiſe to purge all Trades and Manufactures from corruptions that had grown upon them, to rectifie and ſanctifie them, that men might live upon them like Chriſtians; which thing he, together with others, had happily begun, and perfected the ſame in two of them, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as one of the great effects of Charity is Concord and Union, ſo had he a wonderful care to conſerve, encreaſe and perfect it in himſelf and others; wherefore he lived in perfect amity with all the world, with Seculars, Eccleſiaſticks, and Religious, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſpecting, and ſpeaking honorably of them all; and when any difference fell out among them, he was greatly afflicted for it, endeavoring by all means, to pacifie and unite their ſpirits, and to accord their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; knowing, that the God whom we worſhip, is a God of peace, who would have us live in peace, and that never any diſcord comes from him, but from the Devil, the ſower of Tares; that nothing is more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, that ſpirit of Union and Love, than Diviſion and Schiſmes in Charity, making us not live like brothers, but ſtrangers and enemies; that inſtead of profiting in vertue, we mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply and encreaſe our ſins and vices: The ſpirit of the new Law, is a ſpirit of ſuch perfect Charity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Union, that (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) it makes no diſtinction, as to the heart of Jew nor Gentile, of Barbarian nor Scythian, of bond nor free, but Jeſus
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115611:73"/>Chriſt is all to all, to unite, and cloſe, and oblige them all in himſelf: According to which this true Chriſtian writeth thus, in one of his letters:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The words which we ought chiefly to imprint upon our hearts, are thoſe of mutual love, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour bequeathed us in the cloſe of his Teſtament; this love ſhould inſpirit all Chriſtians, to perfect them in one, and cauſe them to live and converſe together as brethren and children, yea, as one ſole childe of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe this Union with Chriſt our Saviour, to whom we all belong, is the beſt and moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpoſition in ſuch as are employed about the good of their neighbor, to the end that they may receive from him both light and ſtrength, to enable them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his purpoſes, together with his ſaving Spirit, to aſſiſt and ground them in all vertues, and eſpecially ſuch as qualifie a man for that purpoſe; therefore his utmoſt endeavour was, to unite himſelf intimately to him, and in all things to act by his Spirit, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire theſe vertues, and render himſelf perfect in them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe vertues are ſet down by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> upon which he made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reflections, and long meditations; and although he carried always the New Teſtament in his pocket, yet that he might read and conſider them often, he wrote them down with his own hand, carrying it apart about with him: The Contents whereof were,

                  </p>
                  <p>Charity is patient, full of ſweetneſs, envieth not, is not malicious nor hurtful, is neither vain nor am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, ſeeketh not her own intereſts, is not froward nor cholerick, thinks no ill, but interprets all to a good ſenſe, rejoyceth not at the faults of others; but on the contrary, takes great content in others well-doing, ſuffereth much, believeth all things, not out of feebleneſs of ſpirit, but out of goodneſs and holy ſimplicity; if its neighbor mend not preſently, hopes always that he will, and in the interim beareth all things from him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the vertues in which he muſt be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly exerciſed, that will deal profitably with his Neighbor, without which he labors in vain; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will ſhew him, that after much time and pains, he ſhall profit little; for the more any one is filled from God, and animated by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, the more ſhall he advance holineſs in himſelf, and good in others; yea, though his words be few and ordinary, for that our employments receive not their force, from the hands that acts them, nor our words from the mouth that utters them, as from the diſpoſition of the heart, and the Spirit that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates it.</p>
                  <p>Now as bare Vertue alone, is not ſufficient to compleat a man for this deſign, but one muſt alſo have a capacity thereunto. So this charitable man,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115611:74"/>beſides that capacity wherewith God had abundantly furniſhed him, as well of a great wit, piercing, ſolid, well diſpoſed, reſolute, laborious and conſtant; as of a body well made, of a good grace and preſence; and beſides the Sciences and fine knowledge which he had learnt in his youth; he had alſo by his own induſtry and travel (being good at every thing) learnt ſeveral things, not onely for his own uſe, but to teach them to others, whereby to help themſelves, or make ſome other uſe of them; as, to let blood, to make medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for cuting of wounds, to compound remedies for ſeveral diſeaſes, of which he had books writ with his own hand, which he communicated, abaſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to learn the meaneſt skills, which might any way be uſeful to others.</p>
                  <p>One day in <hi>Paris,</hi> he carried a friend with him to a poor man, who got his living with making hots and wicker baskets, in a cave; into which he entred, and in the preſence of his friend, finiſhed a hot which he had begun ſome days before, with deſign, having learned the thing, to teach it to ſome poor people in Countrey, to help to get their living: he left the hot, and a peice of money to boot for teaching him, with the poor man, which indeed deſerved to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in ſome Cabinet of Rarities, or rather in ſome place of Devotion, as a glorious Monument of an Heroick Charity.</p>
                  <p>Underſtanding when he was at <hi>Dijon,</hi> that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Veſelines, whom he affected very much, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, out of Charity, Drugs and Medicines for poor people; he was much pleaſed with it, and to improve their good work, taught the Siſters belonging to the Infirmary, to make ſome excellent Compoſitions,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115611:75"/>which had very great vertue againſt ſeveral maladies, preparing them, diſpenſing and boyling them himſelf, ſtooping to the meaneſt and moſt troubleſome labors, as much as could be done by any ſervant, holding his head for a long time over the ſmoak of thoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which ſent forth no pleaſant fumes, before a great fire, not deſiſting till all in a ſweat, without any word or ſign at all of complaining of what he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Religious deſired him to ſuffer the lay Siſters to help and aſſiſt him, but his minde was ſo ſet upon it, that they muſt let him alone, and give place to that fire of Charity, which inflamed him all within, and which ſweetned unto him, or rather conſumed all the the pains, the outward material fire could inflict; yea, and moreover he urged them out of great prudence, to acquaint him with the hours of their devotions, and ſet times of their meetings, that he might not divert them from theſe, being a punctual obſerver of the time they appointed him, that he failed not one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, though with much difficulty, conſidering his ſeveral other employments, to which he ſtood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.</p>
                  <p>The like he obſerved in all other things, inſomuch that he took upon him all ſhapes, transformed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into any figure, condeſcended to all accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the good of his neighbor; and all theſe by vertue of this celeſtial fire, which melted and caſt him wholy into the mould of Charity, his thoughts, words, actions, and each thing in him was charity, which made him ſay one day thus, in a letter to one of his great Confidents:</p>

                     <p>FIrſt of all, concerning his Charity and affection to the poor, I ſhall ſay this, that Jeſus Chriſt was not onely the fountain from whence this grace did flow, but alſo the motive and object, in that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him in them, and him chiefly he imagined to aſſiſt and ſerve in their perſons: ſo that his thoughts ſtayed not upon their torn and ragged habit, nor upon their vile and deſpicable outſide, which naturally diſpleaſeth the eye, offendeth the ſmell and other ſenſes: But paſſing further, he beheld within and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe, with the eye of faith, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt preſent and dwelling in them, whom he eſteemed as his native images, loved and valued by him: And as he burned with an ardent affection toward our Lord, ſo he loved tenderly the poor, ſuccoured them with all his might, and left nothing unattempted for their ſakes: With theſe eyes, and not thoſe of nature, muſt each one behold the poor, that will love them indeed, and have bowels of compaſſion, and a true reſolved and conſtant Charity to towards them.</p>

                     <p>In the ſecond place, reſolving to give you this Charity by retail, we will begin with that which he exerciſed in his houſe; where from the year, 1641. he invited to dinner poor men, two in number, and at firſt twice every week, on <hi>Tueſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays;</hi> but five or ſix years after, finding himſelf much engaged in other ſervices, for the honor of God and good of his neighbor, he reduced them to one day, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily was <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and then invited three; which he ordered in this manner, willing to joyn his Spiritual Alms with his Corporal (an important ſecret, to be learned and practiſed by all charitable perſons, each one according to their capacities) he ſought out ſuch poor, as ſeemed to him to have greateſt need of inſtruction; wherefore during his abode at <hi>Paris,</hi> after his morning devotions, he went to S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> gate, and there took up ſuch as were newly arrived, whom courteouſly ſaluting, he brought home, and if it were winter, brought them to the fire, always making them ſit down; and afterwards, with a cordial affection, which appeared in his countenance and whole deportment, and with a marvellous grace, he inſtructed them in what was needful for them to know, in the myſteries of the Holy Trinity, the Incarnation of our Lord, and Holy Sacrament. He likewiſe inſtructed them how to make Confeſſion, and to communicate worthily, and in brief, how to live vertuouſly; this done, he gave them water to waſh, ſet them down at table, where himſelf ſerved bareheaded, with exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and ſet the diſhes before them with his own hands, brought in by his children and ſervants, in which his Lady alſo had a great hand, enjoyned ſilence to others whilſt they were eating, providing that they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115611:76"/>ſhould feed freely and familiarly: after dinner diſmiſt them with an Alms, himſelf waiting on them to the gate, with very great reverence, and ſome wholeſome diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>He muſt be very much a Chriſtian, that could do in this manner; and a Nobleman of his age and quality, who ſtoops to ſuch ſervices, muſt have his eyes very ſtrongly fixed upon his Saviour, otherwiſe ſuch offices will go down with much difficulty. Its true indeed, a Courtier will make no ſcruple, but rather a point of honor and delight, to wait upon his Soveraign, diſguiſed in rags or ſome poor habit; but then he muſt be well aſſured it is the King, and no other. Many perſons of quality in <hi>Paris,</hi> and elſewhere, being preſent at this ſo holy and Chriſtian an action, were much taken therewith, and encouraged to imitate it, at leaſt in part. This laudable cuſtom he continued to his death; and when his occaſions would not permit him to perform it in his own perſon, his Lady did the ſame to ſo many poor women.</p>
                     <p>His other cuſtom was, on that day in the week that Chriſtmas day fell upon every year, to invite a poor childe of ten or twelve years old to dinner; and on the day of the Epiphany, to invite a woman with a ſucking childe, in honor of the myſterie of that day; likewiſe one Midſummer day, in honor of S: <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> his Patron, he invited twelve poor people, waiting upon them himſelf; and on <hi>Maundy Thurday</hi> did the like, after he had waſhed their feet.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, and ſeveral other Charities and Alms at his own houſe, he endeavored the general relief of all the poor in <hi>Paris,</hi> and all other places thereabouts, as much as poſſible; buſied himſelf to underſtand their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115611:77"/>wants, ſtudied ways of remedy, and carefully proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them; and what he could not accompliſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he commended to others, ſpake for them, begg'd for them, bought neceſſaries for them, and carried them with his own hands; ſtudied to eſtabliſh ſettled courſes of living, for men and children that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute; and when he could not at preſent provide for them abroad, he kept and maintained them at his own houſe, until he could conveniently put them forth.</p>
                     <p>He was the firſt that thought upon and motioned ſome relief for poor Engliſh Catholicks, driven by perſecution out of their Countrey, ingaging perſons of quality in the purchaſing of Lands for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and having brought it to perfection, himſelf undertook the charge of diſtributing one part of this Charity; which he performed monethly, going to them a foot, and commonly alone, having made choice of thoſe quarters which were moſt remote, where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring their chamber, he ſaluted them with tenderneſs and compaſſion, and after in a very civil and reſpectful way, he gave them their allowance, lapt up in a paper privately. One day in his return from this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſpake to a friend on this manner:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Certainly theſe are good Chriſtians, who have left all for God, where as we live in plenty, whilst theſe content themſelves with two Crowns a moneth, having parted with thouſands for their conſcience, and endure with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſuch conſiderable loſſes: O Sir, Chriſtianity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in words or ſhews, but in deeds.</hi>

                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:115611:77"/>
                     <p>Furthermore, this wiſe and charitable man, joyned with his care of the poor, one conſiberable point of prudence; <hi>viz.</hi> after his viſits and ſurvey taken of their wants in groſs, he examined in particular as well their ſpiritual as corporal neceſſities, and endeavored in the firſt place to mark their inclinations, their paſſions their ill habits, what vices were predominate in them, what were their chief infirmities; that like a prudent Phyſitian, he might apply fit remedies, duly exhorting them to live like Chriſtians, and to make a ſanctified uſe of their poverty.</p>
                     <p>As to their temporal neceſſities, he conſidered each ones capacity, induſtry, trade, and employment of each: if Tradeſmen, he conſidered what was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſet them to work, what tools or materials, which accordingly he provided, either buying new ones, or redeeming their own laid at pawn; bought materials, giving them proviſion of bread for two to three days, and procuring them work, and that not onely for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but their wives and children, and afterwards bought ſome of their work, and beſtowed it in Alms upon others, took order for the quick ſale of others commodities, encouraging them to take pains, and avoid idleneſs, coming from time to time to viſit them, and ſee if all went well with them.</p>
                     <p>To theſe we may adde, his Charity to poor Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whom he viſited, comforted, and relieved, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating and procuring their liberty, when he found it expedient for the good of their ſouls: For one day he returned this anſwer, to ſome that made ſuit to him for the releaſe of him whom we are now coming to ſpeak of:</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:115611:78"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We often get men out of Priſon, who make uſe of their liberty to the diſhonor of God, and their own destruction, for whom it had been better they had remained in durance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This being firſt conſidered, he afterwards labored for their enlargement with great affection; of which I ſhall now give a pregnant proof.</p>
                     <p>There was in Low-<hi>Normandy,</hi> a Priſoner for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years, who was both innocent, and in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; ſeveral perſons had endeavored his freedom, but without ſucceſs, by reaſon of a potent adverſary: The buſineſs was commended to Monſieur <hi>Renty;</hi> who after a juſt information of the caſe, undertook the matter, choſe an honeſt man, a Maſter of Requeſts, where the cauſe depended, to make report of it to the Counſel; commended the proſecution of it to his own Advocate, went in his own perſon often to ſee and ſollicite it, undertaking for the charge of the whole buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all this, perceiving the cauſe to hang long, and the Priſoner to languiſh in miſery, he changed his purpoſe, writ to his adverſary in his behalf; requeſted that the buſineſs might be referred to him, promiſing to make a journey into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and there to accommodate the matter to his content. When he came thither, he preſently ſet up a Miſſion in his Pariſh of <hi>Beny;</hi> from whence taking along with him one of the Fathers of the Miſſion, he went to the Town where both patties were.</p>
                     <p>When his coming was noiſed in that place, all the ſtreets were filled with people, bleſſing God for his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115611:78"/>coming; and underſtanding the occaſion thereof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that none but he could accompliſh that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or put an end to that poor mans miſery, praiſing God that had choſen ſuch a holy man, with a thouſand good p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ayers for him. He went ſtrait to the Priſon, where the Father made an exhortation to the Priſoners, to ſtrengthen and comfort them, which he ſeconded with his Alms; after which, he promiſed the poor man to go to his adverſary, to induce him by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and perſwade him with intreaties, to grant his enlargement; in the mean time, that he ſhould pray to God to bleſs his endeavors, and ſhould reſt in hope, that by ſome means or other, with Gods grace, he ſhould be delivered.</p>
                     <p>Thence he went to the other parties houſe, whom he treated with all perſwaſive means, returning back to the Priſon to receive information upon ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that occur'd betwixt them; where finding all the Priſoners together at their uſual devotions, he waited till they had done, though it was very late, towards ſeven a clock, having two leagues to go after that to his own houſe, where it was ten a clock at night before his return: having at length taken inſtructions from his Priſoner, he went back to the other party, with whom he came to ſuch an agreement, that this poor man, after nine years Impriſonment, and a world of miſery, by his ſollicitation and Charity, was releaſed, whom he obliged to come to Confeſſion and Communion to the Fathers of the Miſſion, and render thanks to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for his deliverance; and to aſſiſt him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therein, according to his cuſtom of adding Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Charity, he maintained him eight days at his own houſe, diſcourſing with him every evening, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115611:79"/>him to a good life; and at his departure, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to go ſee his adverſary, whom he found now as ſweet and as tractable; as before he had been incenſed againſt him. And ſince that time, being made Prieſt, he was one at the Church of <hi>Beny,</hi> to ſay Maſs for the intention of his Deliverer.</p>

                     <p>IF his Charity was thus great toward the poor, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it was far greater to ſuch poor as were ſick; for in them he beheld a double object of this moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Vertue, Poverty and Sickneſs, both which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, did kindle a redoubled flame in his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate affections.</p>
                     <p>We ſcarce read of any thing in the lives of the greateſt Saints of this ſubject, which he did not practiſe: It was of ſuch an extent and progreſs, that not content to aſſiſt them in one or two ways, they found in him, and that often in one viſit, a Benefactor, a Phyſitian, Apothecary, Chyrurgion, Paſtor, Father, Brother, Friend and Servant, comforting them every way, and in ſuch faſhions as have not formerly been known or practiſed, eſpecially by perſons of his rank and quality.</p>
                     <p>In the year, 1641. he learnt to let blood, and other parts of Chyrurgery, he endeavored to know how to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115611:79"/>make all ſorts of Medicines; and to that end, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with a Phyſician, by whom he was inſtructed in ſome principal things of this Art; wherein his deſign was not the bare knowledge, but the practice: When ever he went abroad either in Town or Countrey, he carried about him a Chyrurgeons Box, and ſeveral Powders, for the cure of moſt ordinary diſeaſes: Theſe he uſed with great dexterity and confidence, yet pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently enough, never advancing raſhly beyond his skill in caſes of difficulty.</p>
                     <p>In his viſits of the ſick, he never ſhunned any ſervice neceſſary for them, and in his power to perform; as, making their beds, helping them to bed, making their fire, waſhing their diſhes, ſetting in order their little houſhold ſtuff, fitting every thing; hoping hereby to win upon the affections of thoſe poor people, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to comfort, and exhort them to patience, and draw them to God with more facility. He was ſeen one Day at <hi>Dijon</hi> (which place was an ample Theater of his vertues, for many moneths of his abode there) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Cloak, with a potſheard in his hand, begging fire at ones door, for a poor ſick body. In which Town, after he had once or twice viſited ſick folks, in company of ſuch as ſhewed him their dwellings, he returned often alone to the ſame, exerciſing towards them greater and more humble acts of Charity, than when in company, ſuccouring and relieving them both by day and night.</p>
                     <p>In the year, 1640 viſiting ſeveral ſick folks in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Paris,</hi> he met with a Religious woman, who had the care of them, coming out of an houſe, whom he asked what ſhe ſought there? who anſwered, Jeſus Chriſt, and that ſhe came now out of a chamber, where
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115611:80"/>there was great need of Charity. He was much taken with that anſwer; replying, that he ſought him alſo: And ſo both went to that houſe, where there were many ſick perſons, whom notwithſtanding he had already the ſame day viſited, made them broth, given them their break-faſt, and made their beds.</p>
                     <p>This good woman led him to ſeveral other places, where he inſtructed the ſick, and gave them Alms, and afterward he continued this holy exerciſe in her company, ſetting apart for it one day in the week, which commonly was Friday; on which he made his viſits, let them blood, wiping his hands not with any fine linnen, but with any diſh-clout that came next hand; adminiſtring proper remedies for their diſeaſes, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſerving their neceſſities, but chiefly their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ones, comforting and encouraging them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them for a good Confeſſion, and worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. Informing himſelf in each Family, whether God was ſerved there? whether any quarrels or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences were amongſt them? which he was careful to take up, eſpecially amongſt poor folks, whom when ever he met with them, though in the ſtreets, he would admoniſh of their fault, and endeavor to accord them.</p>
                     <p>Finally, he never left ſuch places, without providing for all their neceſſities, which he took notice of with incredible Charity, ſweetneſs and reſpect; diſpenſing with other buſineſs, that he might have ſufficient time to hear all their complaints with invincible pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>In all his journeys, as ſoon as he alighted, he went to the Church, to adore the bleſſed Sacrament (as we have mentioned elſewhere) after which, he enquired
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115611:80"/>if there were any Hoſpitals in that place; whither (if the time would permit) he failed not to go, viſiting their ſick, enquiring if ſufficient care was taken for them, adminiſtring what remedies he could, with his hand, by Bleeding and Medicines, and with his words, in ſweetning their pains, by good diſcourſe and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and with his Alms.</p>
                     <p>In the great Hoſpital of <hi>Paris,</hi> this honourable mention hath been made of him, We have ſeen Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Renty</hi> frequenting this Hoſpital for twelve years together and upwards, with wonderful diligence; both at his entrance and departure he went to the Church, where he remained ſometime before the B.

Moreover, he taught the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious women that waited on them, to make ſome oyntments they knew not formerly, and made them himſelf before them in the place. Commonly he came thither alone, ſomtime in company of ſome Noblemen of good quality; who encouraged by ſuch an example, ſtrove to imitate it in ſome ſort, and to have a part in ſuch holy actions.</p>
                     <p>Neither did he onely viſit the ſick; but they likewiſe ſought him, and would finde him out where ever he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115611:81"/>came, if they were able to go abroad. At <hi>Dijon</hi> they would come to him in troops, for all ſorts of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and diſtempers. In the year, 1642, going to his eſtate in <hi>Normandy,</hi> he ſpent about four moneths in theſe works of mercy, adminiſtring Phyſick and Chyrurgery to all ſick of that Countrey, in ſuch ſort, that from all quarters they came to him, and in ſuch multitudes daily, that one could ſcarce come near him. This puts me in minde of that we read of our Saviour, how from all parts they brought to him all that were ſick of all diſeaſes, to be healed by him; which ſeems to be repreſented in ſome meaſure by this his ſervant and true diſciple, in that the ſick, the weak, the lame, or otherwiſe in firm; came to him from all ſides; and we have ſeen him compaſſed about with a throng of them, ſome to be let blood, ſome for his oyntments, ſome for his powders or other medicines; ſome for counſel or conſolation, ſome for an alms, or for eaſe in ſome caſe or other. Treating all with the like diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Chriſtian Charity, with the like bowels of pitty and compaſsion, the like ſpirit of love, as wherewith the Son of God, of whom he received it, had pitty upon us.

                     <p>At his Caſtle at <hi>Beny,</hi> he entertained poor people infected with ſcall'd heads, lodging them in a chamber fitted and furniſhed for them; where himſelf viſited them, plucking off their ſcabs with his plaiſters; at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and feeding them till their recovery. At <hi>Paris</hi> likewiſe he viſited the ſame in the Suburbs of S. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> (which was their uſual abode) carrying them ſome collections of Alms, joyning Humility alſo with his Charity; foraſmuch as he hath been ſeen ſtanding in the midſt of theſe noyſome ſick folks bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, attending to a Sermon which he had procured for them.</p>

                     <p>This good mans Charity, like a perpetual motion, giving him no reſt or truce, not for a moment, carried him inſtantly to viſit this poor creature, and to provide for her extremity: In the firſt place, he hireth a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to attend her, and deals with her Hoſt to keep her there: after this, he provides her Dyer-drinks, and Phyſick proper for her diſeaſe, bringeth her broths his own ſelf, with all other convenient nouriſhment; ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by her a long time at each viſit, and whilſt ſhe was in a ſweat, wipes her with his own handkerchief, uſing the ſame himſelf afterward, a thing more admirable than imitable: Moreover, having as great a care of her ſoul as body, inſtructs and comforts her, taking the pains once in a day to read her a Lecture out of ſome Book of Devotion; enduring with much courage and delight all the difficulties of trouble and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſo noyſome a diſeaſe could preſent, by its ſtench and rottenneſs: at all which, his heart leapt, as if it had been entertained by ſome delicate perfume, which was, no doubt, the ſweet odour of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115611:82"/>whom he look'd upon in theſe poor people (as we have ſaid before) which perfumed all their infections, and cauſed him to finde delicacies in the greateſt loath-ſomeneſs.</p>
                     <p>In fine, by his care, he retrived this poor creature from miſery, and the very jaws of death, brought her into the ſtate of a good Chriſtian; inſomuch, that ſhe ſpent the reſt of her time very vertuouſly; and when ever ſhe came to the Monaſtery of the Veſulines, ſhe could not hold from relating, with great f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which we may add his ardent deſire for the erecting of an Hoſpital for the infected with the Kings Evil, there being none ſuch in <hi>Paris,</hi> nor in all <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus did this great ſervant of God imploy himſelf about diſeaſes, and thoſe the moſt noyſome. And now let us conſider what bleſſings and ſucceſs God gave to his endeavours and Medicines, which will appear little leſs than miraculous. Being in low <hi>Normandy,</hi> much buſied amongſt his ſick people, men were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to ſee how he cured all diſeaſes, even the moſt deſperate and extraordinary; and that with remedies ſometimes, which ſcarce appeared to have any thing in them; which made thoſe that took notice of them apt to believe, that the cures were wrought, not ſo
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115611:83"/>much by any natural power of the Medicines, as by Grace and Miracle.</p>
                     <p>The ſame opinion they had at <hi>Dijon,</hi> of the cures he wrought there, that they were healed by ſome way ſupernatural. To which purpoſe, I cannot let paſs, the diſcourſe he had with the Prioreſs of the Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, a great Confident of his, whom he viſited often, to whom he related, how a little before, a woman in child-bed, had been ſick unto death, and given over by all the Phyſicians, whom he viſited notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and tryed whether in ſo great extremity, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies might miniſter any eaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I went to her</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>and made up the beſt Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine I had, yet ſuch, as I could not imagine to have ſo great a vertue, as to cure that diſeaſe: What then? having no better, I prayed to God for his bleſſing upon that, if it might be for his glory, and the good of the Patient. God did it; for coming to viſit her again, I found her well recovered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prioreſs asking him, if he did thus often? he anſwered:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Yes, when he was deſired it; for theſe being poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have no other help, neither have I any better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies: I know my Saviour is not tyed to Medicines; we muſt have faith in him, where we can do nothing our ſelves; and that out of his bounty he hath beſtowed on me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She replyed, but this is then a miracle?</p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:115611:83"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And doth not he work miracles for us every day?</hi> ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>And do you ſuch for the poor? ſaid the Prioreſs? To which he anſwered with great humility and well beſeemingneſs in theſe words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lady Prioreſs calls that a miracle, which our Lord hath wrought; for my part, I have no ſhare in it, but onely by beſtowing on the poor ſuch as I have, make what you pleaſe of it; all my reflection thereupon is, onely to return praiſe to my Saviour Chriſt when the cure is done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Holy Scriptures command us to honour the Phyſician for our neceſſity of him: Undoubtedly, thoſe are much more to be honoured, who proceed in their cures, not ſo much according to the method and direction of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> as that of God.</p>

                     <p>THis part of Charity will appear greater and more ardent in Monſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> than the former, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt ſublime and nobleſt degree of it, as ſaith S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> And the firſt, in regard of its object the Soul, which is incomparably more excellent than the body. And ſecondly, in regard of the things beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this way of Charity, which infinitely ſurpaſs thoſe other, as much as an eternal poſſeſſion in the heavens, conveyed by the one, ſuperlatively exceeds bread, ſilver, health, ſupplied by the other: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his holy prudence clearly perceiving a difference, was tranſported with far other affections to the one, than to the other.</p>
                     <p>And being continually inflamed with the love of God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, unceſſantly ſought all ways, and uſed all means, to make them known and beloved, both here and eternally, by all men; preventing what he could any offence, or ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, daily pondering with himſelf, the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable goodneſs and tenderneſs of God towards the ſouls of men, which have been ſo dear to him, and coſt him ſuch an invaluable price. He entred into the ſame affections, loving, and deſiring their ſalvation, according to that Model.</p>
                     <p>This zeal of his was admirable, having all the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115611:84"/>to render it perfect: Being in the firſt place univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, extended to all in <hi>France,</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> yea, all the world over: Inſomuch, that he ſaid to one of his Familiars, that he was ready to ſerve all men, not excepting one, and even to lay down his life for any one upon occaſion: He earneſtly deſired to convert, to enlighten with the knowledge of God, to inflame with his love, to ſanctifie and ſave the whole world, if it had been in his power; of which <hi>Paris</hi> being, as it were an Epitome, he went through all the quarters and ſtreets of that vaſt City, ſearching out what he could remove or bring in, for the glory of God, and ſalvation of ſouls: And the ſame Spirit of God that conducted him in this inquiry, bleſſed his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and gave him the favour to rectifie what was out of courſe, to confirm the wayering, to ſtrengthen what was in order, to root out vice, and plant vertue: Which he did in ſo many ſeveral ways, as a man would think it impoſſible; but what cannot a man do, that is zealous, diſintereſted, and full of God?</p>
                     <p>He performed what poſſibly he could, in his own perſon, not ſparing any coſt, nor loſing one minute of time; and wherein his power and ſtrength of body or minde, falling ſhort of his deſires, proved defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, he engaged others: Whereupon, he procured Miſſions at his own charge, in his own Countreys of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Brie;</hi> and by joynt contribution of others, erected the like in many other Provinces, where he had no Land; as, in <hi>Burgundy, Picardy, Chartrain,</hi> and elſewhere.</p>

                     <p>In a Memorial from <hi>Caen,</hi> we have theſe words, Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> hath ſettled here many Aſſemblies of devout perſons, whom he advertiſed to meet once a week, and conſult about relief of the poor, and the preventing of offences againſt God, which hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded marvellouſly.

                     <p>He writ to a Superiour of one of the Miſsions in theſe words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I was united in Spirit to you on Sunday laſt, which I conceived to be the time of opening your Miſſion.

                     <p>It was his earneſt deſire and deſign to plant the Spirit of Chriſtianity in all Families, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage people of all conditions, to ſerve God in good earneſt, having ſpecial care of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                     <p>We mentioned before, what is recorded of his Charity in inſtructing the poor, at the great Hoſpital in <hi>Paris.</hi> And now I ſhall relate how he behaved himſelf in that of St. <hi>Gervaiſe;</hi> where paſsing by, one day, in the year, 1641. he enquired to what Charities that place was devoted. To which anſwer was made, that they lodged poor Travellers: He was much pleaſed with this Inſtitution; and perceiving withal, that ſo great a number of poot that lodged there every night, wanted inſtruction, he found himſelf moved from God, to perform that Office: And ſhortly after, came to beg of the Superiour, with great humility and ſubmiſsion, leave to Catechize them in the evening, when they were aſſembled together. To which the Superiour willingly aſſented, without any knowledge of him, who would not tell his name, but concealed himſelf for the ſpace of ſix-Moneths.</p>
                     <p>He undertook the imployment, and performed it with great content, becauſe every night he found there new comers, whom he duly Catechized and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; coming thither commonly alone, and on foot, both Summer and Winter, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115611:93"/>not eaſily be expreſſed. When he met any one at the Hoſpital, he ſaluted them with great reſpect, and put them before him, talked with them bareheaded, and very reverently. If at any time they kneeled to him, he did the like to them; and continued on his knees, till they roſe firſt. One of them obſerving him dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and knowing him to be Lord of the place where himſelf lived, was deeply affected, to ſee theſe things; and came and fell down at his feet. Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> did the like to him, continuing in that poſture for a long time, reſolving not to riſe, before the poor man. He uſed to receive them in his arms, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them with tender affection.</p>
                     <p>Theſe actions proceeding from a perſon of his birth and quality, and produced by the holy Spirit of God, wrought wonderful effects:</p>
                     <p>And that firſt, in theſe poor Paſſengers, who aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at ſuch ardent Charity, joyned with ſuth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found humility, were exceedlingy moved thereby, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that tears of Devotion were ſeen flowing from their eyes, and themſelves falling down at his feet, with ſigns of repentance for their ſins, and a deſign of a better life; begging his counſel and aſſiſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and beginning it, with going to Confeſſion and the Sacrament the next day.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in thoſe Religious women that belonged to this Hoſpital; who taking fire at his example, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do the like, in daily ſerving the poor, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them their Prayers and Catechiſm, with the ten Commandments, which offices they had never done before. Together with many other good things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to their own attaining to perfection, and the better governing of their Hoſpital: which he infuſed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115611:94"/>into them, and they do ſtill continue with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; he having ſeveral times told them, that he hoped in time, to ſee God greatly glorified and ſerved among them; as we ſee it is come to paſs at this day, and may truly affirm, that this gallant man hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to ſo much good done there, both within doors and without, and doubt not, but he hath already received the reward thereof in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>But let us further conſider ſome other effects of his zeal: Going one day with a friend to viſit the holy place of <hi>Mont-Matre,</hi> to which he had great Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; after his prayers ſaid in the Church, he retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deſolate place of the Mountain, near a little ſpring, which (as it is ſaid) St. <hi>Denis</hi> made uſe of, where he kneeled down to his prayers; which ended, made his dinner of a piece of bread, and draught of water: Grace being ſaid, he took out the New Teſtament, which he always carried in his pocket, and read a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon his knees, bareheaded, with extraordinary reverence.</p>
                     <p>In this juncture of time, came thither a poor man, ſaying his Chaplet. Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> roſe up to ſalute him, and fell into a diſcourſe with him concerning God, and that ſo powerfully, that the good man ſtriking his breaſt, fell down upon the ground, to adore that great God, making ſuch evident appearances of the great impreſſions that were wrought upon his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that ſtruck Monſieur <hi>Rexty</hi> and his friend with much aſtoniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after this, came a poor Maid to draw water at the well: Whom he asked what ſhe was? She anſwered, a Servant: But do you know, ſaith he,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115611:94"/>that you are a Chriſtian, and to what end you were created? Whereupon he took occaſion to inſtruct her, in what he conceived neceſſary for her to know; and ſo to the purpoſe, that ſhe confeſsing her former ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, told him ingenuouſly, that before that hour, ſhe had never thought of her ſalvation; but promiſed from thence forward, to take it into ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and go to Confeſsion.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſtill proceed a little higher, on the ſame ſubject: In his return from <hi>Dijon,</hi> after his firſt jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney thither, accompanied with two noble pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, about ſome four leagues: He ſtopped three or four times by the way, to Catechize poor Paſſengers, and one time went far out of his way, to do the ſame to ſome labourers in the field, inſtructing them how to ſanctifie their work they were about.</p>
                     <p>A young Maid in <hi>Paris,</hi> having been very cruelly uſed by her Uncle, fell into ſo great diſorder and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, that all in a fury, ſhe accuſed our bleſſed Saviour to be the cauſe of her miſery, in abondoning her to the barbarous uſage of ſuch a man, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving her. In this horrid plight of conſcience, ſhe went to receive the Sacrament, ſeveral times in a day, at ſeveral Churches, that ſhe might not be diſcovered: And this upon deſign, to do deſpite to our Saviour, to provoke him to finiſh her deſtruction, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, letting her to fall into the abyſs of miſery and hell for ever.</p>
                     <p>Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> advertiſed of this ſad accident, and conſidering the great offence againſt God, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of this poor creature, was tranſported with zeal ſpeedily to finde her out: Which after eight days pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit from ſeveral Churches, at length he did, meeting
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115611:95"/>with her in the very act of Communicating: Taking witneſſes, he conveyed her to an Hoſpital for Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks; where he took ſo great care both of her ſoul and body, that ſhe returned to herſelf, and gave ample teſtimonies of her converſion and repentance for thoſe horrid enormities.</p>
                     <p>Neither did his zeal reach onely to thoſe that were near him, but ſuch alſo as were abſent, and far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; to whom he had no other relation, but what was contracted by his alliance to our bleſſed Saviour, and his own Charity. Underſtanding the news that was current ſome years ſince, of a War the Turk de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned againſt the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and to beſiege the Iſland; he ſo far intereſted himſelf in their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that he recommended it twice, by Letter, to the prayers of Siſter <hi>Margaret,</hi> Carmelite, of the B: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament at <hi>Beaulne,</hi> whom he deemed to have great power with God. His firſt Letter runs thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I commend to your prayers, and of the holy Family, the Order of the Knights of St.</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which is at this preſent in great danger, and with them the whole Chriſtian World, What that common Potent enemy of our faith will do, I know not one. Our little Jeſus, who is all love and power, knows how to vindicate his own glory, pleaſe you therefore to commend it to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſecond Letter thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I beſeech the Omnipotency of the holy Babe Jeſus, to preſerve his children under the Croſs, and to purifie them for his own work. This is it, which I requeſt for our Brethren of the Order of St.</hi> John Baptiſt <hi>of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>

                     <p>THe deſign of advancing the Salvation of mens ſouls is attended in this world with much doing, and much ſuffering. It is neceſſary therefore for him that undertakes the task, to fortifie himſelf with courage and patience: And both theſe, were moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in Monſieur <hi>Renty;</hi> being in the firſt place, full of courage, reſolute and laborious, imploying his body, as if he had two more in reſerve, when that was ſpent, diſpatching more buſineſs in one half hour, than others would have done in many days: Very ſtout he was to undergo any difficulties, and withal, very quick and deciſive.</p>
                     <p>A certain Lady of note, made him her executor, having diſpoſed in her will very much to pious uſes: He was informed that her friends, being perſons of eminent power, were diſpleaſed therewith. To which he replyed with a truly Chriſtian courage and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, I never moved the Lady to beſtow any of her eſtate this way; but ſince her Piety hath prompted her thereunto, I ſhal ſpare no pains therein, nor be diſmaid with any power that ſhall oppoſe it: My care ſhall be to perform her will, &amp; for other things I take no thought; for if it come to a matter of Law, I ſhall be ready to plead it, both in behalf of the poor, whoſe Solicitor I am; and for her ſake alſo, in her ſtate of ſufferance, if ſhe be yet therein.</p>
                     <p>His zeal was ever ſtill backed with courage, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115611:96"/>the leaſt haeſitancy, where the honour of God, and good of his neighbour were concerned. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring one day, ſome Gentlemen ingaged in a quarrel, with their ſwords drawn, and in fight, and to kill one another; he reſolutely threw himſelf in the midſt of them, laying hold on thoſe who ſeemed moſt outragious. They begun to quarrel with him; but finding him reſolutely bent to part the fray, and to hazard his own life, for the ſaving of theirs, were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly pacified, and liſtned to his ſober counſel, who took up the quarrel upon the place.</p>
                     <p>Meeting with a man whom ſome Huguenots had perverted, and taken along with them to <hi>Charenton;</hi> who was reſolved likewiſe to force his wife to the ſame place and opinions: He fell into diſcourſe with him, endeavouring, at leaſt, to prevent any ſuch violent courſe with his wife. The man entertained him very rudely, both with neglect of his advice, and obloquy. But this holy man ſuffering his cholar and fury to ſpend themſelves, brought him at length, by his wonted ſweet behavior, to a calmer temper convinc'd him of his blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and erours into which he had thrown himſelf headlong, and after ſeveral viſits, confirmed him in the Catholick verity. Finally, meeting with the principal party that perverted him, threatned him with the Law, in caſe he perſiſted in his courſe; having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to others alſo, whom he had dealt withal in the like kinde; Thus his zeal fruſtrated the others deſigns, and eſtabliſhed this Family in their former Religion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, his zeal was accompanied with unparalled patience, a vertue very requiſite for him, that would render himſelf capable to do good to others, ſeeing he muſt endeavour to win their hearts, at which he is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115611:96"/>to make his firſt entrance, applying himſelf to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and humours, which in very many prove dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and untoward; and not following his own, but ſubduing his paſſions, and renouncing his own will, inſinuating himſelf after a ſort into their diſpoſitions, and being, as it were, changed and metamorphoſed into them; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, waiting long and patiently for their converſion; and attending (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being tired or diſcouraged, notwithſtanding that he findes by all his travels, he wins but little ground) the times and the moments wherein they may profit, and yield to his motives; all which qualities are not acquirable, without great violence offered to ones ſelf, without much ſuffering, and great mortification. To whom therefore may well be applied theſe words of our Saviour, <hi>That grain which thou ſoweſt, if it dye not, remaineth fruitleſs; but if it dye, it ſprouteth, and bringeth forth much fruit.</hi> To the end therefore that we may bring forth fruit amongſt men, we muſt dye to our ſelves, and with this holy man, be indued with zeal and patience, to bear with meakneſs, and great pains of body and minde, in thoſe charitable imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; undergoing the importunities, complaints, paſſions, the repulſes, the contempts and in juries which often are met with in the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>One day he viſited a perſon, who out of jealouſie and a groundleſs ſuſpition, had cruelly uſed his wife, and given her a wound with a knife; who underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his buſineſs, entertained him very courſly, lifting up his hand to ſtrike him, belching out uncivil language, and offering to thruſt him out of doors. Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> took all this patiently, not replying one word: But after ſome time, he drew near again, and embraced
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115611:97"/>him, and accoſted him with ſuch ſoft language, that he was perſwaded by him at length to go to confeſſion, which he had not done in twelve years before; and in ſine, reconciled him fully to his wife, and ſo lived and dyed a good Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>Another time he went to ſee a poor old man that lay ſick, whom he boarded with his ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of things concerning his ſalvation: But the old man, whom age, ſickneſs, and want, had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred very crabbed, inſtead of liſtning to him, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to paſſion, telling him that he underſtood thoſe things better than he; and if he would hearken, he would inſtruct him himſelf. Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> anſwered, with all his heart; and after a great deal of patience and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, prudently taking advantage from ſome things in that impertinent and weak diſcourſe, to convince and inform him better, proceeded ſo happily, that he brought him to go to Confeſſion, and the reſt of his days to take great care of his ſouls health:</p>
                     <p>We may adde hereunto, his wonderful diſcretion concerning the faults of others, wherein he exerciſed great parience and courage: Patience, I ſay, in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and courage in admoniſhing and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them.</p>
                     <p>A certain zealous Eccleſiaſtical perſon, did by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requeſt his advice and aſſiſtance, in redreſſing ſome ſcandalous faults that were committed near him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unpuniſhed. To whom he anſwered, he muſt have recourſe to God by his prayers, to procure of his goodneſs, illumination for thoſe ſinners, and grace to mend their lives; adding withal, how hard a thing it was, to redreſs ſuch evils; for our Saviour himſelf, whilſt he was upon earth, did not take away all ſins,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115611:97"/>and ſo muſt we be conſtrained to leave many behinde us, which God permitteth ſometime to be, as well for the exerciſing and purging of the good, as for the puniſhment of the bad.</p>
                     <p>The ſame party advertiſing him of two other things; the one, of ſome conſiderable faults he had noted in a Prieſt, that took upon him the charge of ſouls: The other, how a Canon had ſtruck one of the Fathers of the miſſion, who had reproved him deſervedly for a fault. To him he wrote back thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I humbly thank you for your pains in informing me of what paſſed concerning the Miſsianers. Ye are all fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants of one God, and know how to reverence thoſe graces of God ye ſee in one another; neither are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, how that St.</hi> Peter, <hi>though an Apoſtle, and full of graces, was found culpable, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>tells us: We muſt therefore excuſe the faults of our neighbour, and lay them under our feet. The work of God that acteth in the heart, receiveth its teſtimony from a ſelf-annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, manifeſted by the Patience and Charity of the Saints in Exterior actions: Beg ye the increaſe of theſe graces for thoſe that want them. It was very ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for one Prieſt to ſtrike another; but we know, that Prieſts put our Saviour to death, and we have too many in theſe days of that Function, who hold more of the old Law than the new, which conſiſteth in the alliance and union of Charity with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His patience likewiſe in bearing with the faults and imperfections of others, was very exemplary, ſtill extennating them with ſome word of mitigation, and excuſing and covering them with Charity, if it were
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115611:98"/>poſſible. Being told of one that had put a cheat upon him in a buſineſs of ſmall concernment, belonging to his Law-Suit at <hi>Dijon,</hi> he ſtraightway covered the fault, and by an act of humility ſaid, it is I that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually cheat my God; then changed the diſcourſe to another buſineſs: In this he looked upon the example of God, and his Son our Saviour, who infinitely hating of ſin, and ſhedding his blood for the deſtruction of it; notwithſtanding, daily do ſuffer ſuch an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble multitude of moſt enormous ſinners, with ſo great patience and forbearance: Neither was this his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and connivance at faults, without the deſign to correct them, as much as he could, which he managed with great prudence and courage.</p>
                     <p>When ever he intended to reprove another, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the firſt place accuſed himſelf, the better to diſpoſe their ſpirit, by the example of his own humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ſetting forth of his weakneſs, to receive his ſayings; and afterwards requeſted the ſame Chriſtian office from them back again: All which he performed in ſuch a graceful way, that there be many who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived good, and retain the memory of it to this day.</p>
                     <p>Having one day a deſign to admoniſh one, he began a diſcourſe of that unity of ſpirits and freedom of hearts, that ought to be amongſt Chriſtians, in telling one another the very truths. For want of which, we are ignorant of them, and ſo grow gray in our vices, and carry them along with us to our graves. And therefore, that he ſhould hold himſelf extreamly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, if any one would perform toward him this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The other finding his heart exceedingly ſoftned with this diſcourſe, beſought him to deal freely and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115611:98"/>plainly with him, in telling him, whatſoever in him he ſaw amiſs, which thing then he did.</p>
                     <p>When he had to deal with ſtubborn ſinners, his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was ſharp and ſevere; knowing when it was fir to yield, and when to reprove ſharply. And his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to a friend concerning a third party, was this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take heed of humbling your ſelf before that man, ſuch abaſing of your ſelf in this caſe, will both prejudice him, and the cauſe of God. Reprove him ſeverely and roundly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He put a great difference betwixt Chriſtian patience in our own concernments, and fortitude, requiſite in the things of God, and the good of our Neighbour, and for the worthy preſerving of our juſt Authority.</p>

                     <p>THeſe two qualities likewiſe accompanied his zeal, Freedom and prudence: For although his great Humility, of which we have formerly ſpoken, hath robbed us of the knowledge of many, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable things he did, and cauſed him to conceal many of his inward graces, and outward actions, yet did his zeal bring many of them to light, and compel him to manifeſt them in a ſincere, charitable, and holy ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; where he ſaw it neceſſary for the glory of God, and good of his neighbour; as we may gather from ſome Memorials we have from him. According to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115611:99"/>which neceſſity, and that ſpirit of Charity, ſometime he ſpake directly of himſelf, and ſometime in a third perſon (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> of his own Revelations:) To which purpoſe, ſee how well and fitly he wrote, in the year 1649. to a vertuous Lady:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Give me leave, Madam, to declare unto you my thoughts, concerning that liberty we ought to uſe, in communicating freely the gifts of God beſtowed on us, to ſuch perſons as may reap fruit from them; not ſtifling within our ſelves what we receive from above, whereby we obſtruct a ſecond fruit which God expects from his graces: Which is, after our receiving good from them, to communicate them to others, with charity and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Improving them, like good ſeed ſown in good ground bringing forth abundance of fruit. I wiſh that we would conſider our ſelves, ſet in this world, as a Chryſtal, which placed in the middle of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe. would give free paſſage to all that light it receives from above: And that by good example, by a high eſtimate ſet of vertue, by diſcountenancing of vice, by comforting others, by pious conveaſe, we would impart thoſe talents we have received from heaven, to all creatures; and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſguiſement, or the leaſt claim of propriety. Giving obedience and paſſage to them, as the Chryſtal to light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Furthermore, that all thoſe honours and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we receive from below, ſhould freely paſs through us again up to God, without making any ſtay with us. No otherwiſe than the Chryſtal tranſmits the beams of ſeveral torches ſet under it, purifying, and dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, more ſparkling towards heaven: for this indeed is our bounden duty, to render unto God, all that honor &amp; praiſe, we receive from men, who alone is worthy of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glory. And who hath therefore beſtowed upon us
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115611:99"/>ſuch things as are praiſe-worthy; not that the praiſe thereof ſhould reſt upon us, but paſs thorow us towards him, that he may be bleſſed and praiſed in all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moreover it is obſervable, if nothing be oppoſed to the Chryſtal, to receive that light which paſſeth thorow it, it appeareth not at all: And though the Sun beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his beams from above, and the torches their flames from below, yet theſe, for want of a reflection, remain onely imperceptible in the Chryſtal. In like manner, though we receive the heavenly light, and abundance of graces, if we make no approaches to God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by rendring to the one what is his due, and to the other what is Charitable; it may be we have a light, but that's onely in our ſelves, and hidden under a buſhel: Which being ſo ſtraitly confin'd, cannot produce its effect of communication, and is in danger in a ſhort time to be choaked and extinct.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſider alſo, that when the Sun ſhineth upon a clear Chryſtal, there is not any corporeal thing more capable of that luſtre, or that receives its beams, with ſo great ſplendour. Moreover, betwixt it and the Sun no light is ſeen, but after it hath paſt thorow the Chryſtal, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes bright and glorious, and alſo burns according to the figure to which it is diſpoſed: To ſhew us, that what paſſeth betwixt God and us, is a work onely of the Cloſet, which ought not to appear abroad until it hath paſſed thorow us to others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let us then ſuffer our ſelves to be penetrated by the graces of God, that after their beams have lightned and warmed us, they may afford the like to all about us: Let us imitate that clear Chrystal which compoſed of ſolid matter, yet gives free paſſageonely to the light; let us, like it, be impenetrable to all, but what proceeds from God,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115611:100"/>and returns to him. Let us not, as we commonly do, deſcend to the appetites of ſenſe, and luſt inordinately after earthly things, which is to caſt dirt upon the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal; whereby that which is clear in it ſelf, by reaſon of that filth that invirons it, is no more capable of light, than is the dirt upon it: And if we will reſtore it to its former tranſparency and penetrability, we muſt waſh it well: I mean, our polluted ſouls, in the clear waters of repentance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let as finally, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ffer up our ſelves to our bleſſed Saviour, that we be not defective in the right uſe of his graces which he beſtows upon us, neither for our ſelves, nor for others, that we bury not his talents: Imitating like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe herein the Chryſtal, which is firſt penetrated by light onely, and then ſeattereth it abroad: Let us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear without a Mask before the face of all the world, ſpeaking aloud, both by the mouth of our actions, with the Spouſe in the</hi> Canticles, My Beloved is mine, and I am my Beloveds; <hi>and by our example and diligence, encreaſe the number of thoſe ſouls that thus love, opening and making plain the way of love: For ever bleſſed be the God of love, in whom I am, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>By this Letter we may perceive, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſign of his Humility to hide thoſe gifts and graces he had received: yet his zeal often cauſed him to bring them to light, when the glory of God, and good of his neighbour might be promoted thereby. And yet this he managed with admirable prudence, that though his zeal was free, yet not ſo indiſcreet, as to be its own Herald upon every appearance of doing good; but was very circumſpect, weighing all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time, place, perſons, and neceſſity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115611:100"/>in the ſame Letter, he gave this ſage advice to that Lady, touching the order and meaſure which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be obſerved in this communication:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To ſome we muſt lay open our hearts more freely and exactly, to others more reſervedly, keeping aloof off, and beating about the buſh; to others altogether lockt up, concealing thoſe ſecrets from them, in whom we ſee no diſpoſition at all to make good uſe of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One of the moſt neceſſary qualities of this zeal, whereby to render it profitable, and prevent many miſcarriages, is, that it be well ſeaſoned with diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and prudence, to conſider things well, and execute them in the beſt manner: To foreſee, and prevent miſchiefs, and redreſs them in time, when they have hapned, applying ſuch efficacious remedies, as may have as much of ſweetneſs, and as little of acrimony as may be. And in deſperate caſes, or where the cure would prove worſe than the diſeaſe, to ſuffer, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them; as we do in thoſe of the body; viz. blindeneſs, lameneſs, and crookedneſs; ſouls having ſometimes ſome certain defects, which are, as it were, incorrigible; which God ſuffers often, thereby to ſave and perfect through humility, thoſe that are infected therewith; and others likewiſe who deal with them, by their patience and charity.</p>
                     <p>Thus was Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> both by grace and nature very prudent and adviſed: His zeal made up with all theſe perfections, and guided its ſelf every where with theſe illuminations. One writing to him to procure a pardon for a young Gentleman who had committed murder, his mother promiſing in lieu of that favour
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115611:101"/>eight hundred pound Sterling, to be imployed in works of Piety and Alms. In his firſt anſwer, he deſired to be informed, whether the party was truly penitent for his fault. In the ſecond he writ thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I cannot perſwade my ſelf to ſtir in this buſineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would ſeem, that under the pretence of Alms, impunity is aimed at: I am not willing to foul my hands with the price of blood. In a word, although others undertake the buſineſs without ſcuuple, and I ſee very conſiderable Alms that would come of it; yet for all that, I cannot afford my aſſiſtance. The Divine Providence will never forget his holy poor ones.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One great point of prudence requiſite in a zealous man, is not to overthrow his body with exceſſive tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, nor overcharge his minde with too much buſineſs, which by their number and weight may choak his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions: but ſo to have a care of the ſalvation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as not thereby to neglect his own: but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſtrength to proportion, what ought to be, both to the one and other. Concerning the firſt of theſe, he expreſt himſelf thus to a Clergy man, upon occaſion of ſome diſtemper he had contracted with extraordinary pains in his Miſſion:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Give me leave, Sir, to deal plainly with you, in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you, that amongſt thoſe many cares I have for you; this is not the leaſt, that I would not have you impoſe too much upon your ſelf; and for want of moderation, to render your ſelf altogether unſerviceable. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my uſually takes no ſmall advantage of ſuch free and well diſpoſed natures. You are not herein your own, but a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115611:101"/>man for the whole world; and, with St.</hi> Paul, <hi>a debter to all men; preſerve yoer ſelf therefore, not ſo much, I mean, by making much of, but by forbearing to deſtroy your ſelf by labours and travel: I am told how greatly your endeavours are bleſſed; give me leave from that intereſt my ſelf challengeth therein, with all humility and reſpect, to admoniſh you thus much.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the ſecond, touching our own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he had a ſpecial regard hereto, managing thoſe affairs which belonged to the good of his neighbour, by the rules of a well ordered Charity, which in this caſe begins at home; indiſpenſably performing all his Exerciſes of Devotion, and reſerving a conſiderable part both of the day and night for his converſing with God, and prayer; yea, as he paſſed to and fro in the day time in the ſtreets, he often went into the Churches remaining there whole hours together, before the B. Sacrament, when his occaſions would any way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and eſpecially toward his latter end, as his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments increaſed, ſo was he in continual recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; from which neither his buſineſs, nor any exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior objects did diſtract him: Whereupon a moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friend asking him, whether in that great throng of buſineſs, he obſerved his uſual two hours of prayer. He anſwered, when I can, I keep three hours, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four or five; but when occaſion is offered to ſerve my neighbour, I eaſily quit them, for God of his mercy hath given me the grace, to be inſeparably with him, even in the crowd of buſineſs.</p>

So that one familiarly acquainted with him, ſaid, that he believed him to be indued with an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick ſpirit; for as the Apoſtles received the grace, to inkindle the life of Faith, and fire of Charity, and ſet up the Kingdom of God in all Countreys and places where the Divine Majeſtie ſent them; in like manner was Monſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> even far beyond the bounds of his condition, filled with grace, and aſſiſted by Divine Power, in all the Cities, Villages, Private houſes, as well Religious as Secular, whither the Divine Providence conducted him, to enlighten men with the knowledge of God, and his Son Chriſt Jeſus. To inkindle in their hearts perfect Charity, and bring them to a good life. In all which he was exceedingly bleſſed with happy ſucceſs, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Being one day at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> going to a poor mans houſe, to exerciſe ſome of his ordinary acts of Charity; and hearing a great noiſe of people, ſinging and dancing in the next houſe, he left his poor man, and went in thither, and look'd upon them; who were ſo ſurprized and aſtoniſhed at his preſence, that they preſently quitted their dancing and ſinging: And he fell into a diſcourſe againſt thoſe diſorders and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115611:102"/>diſſoluteneſs in that holy time of <hi>Lent,</hi> with ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as drew tears from their eyes, and wrought ſo effectually upon ſome of them, that the next day they went to Confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Another time, he viſited a poor maid, who being abuſed by a young man, and gotten with childe, was leſt in great neceſſity; whom he found plunged in ſo deep a melancholly, that ſhe had reſolved to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way herſelf; yet by the grace and power, which God gave to his good counſel, he comforted her dejected ſpirits, and brought her into ſuch a condition, that ſhe went to Confeſſion. After this, he went to ſeek out the young man, who at the firſt onſet, behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very ill, contemning his wholeſome advice: But after ſeveral arguments, inforced from the danger of his ſoul, and other threatnings of Gods Judgements hanging over his head, he melted into tears, promiſing to do whatever he pleaſed to command him; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that by his advice, he was reconciled to God by true repentance, and to the maid by wedlock, and ſince that time have led a good life together.</p>
                     <p>During his abode at <hi>Amiens,</hi> a poor woman had undone herſelf by ſelling ſalt (a thing forbidden in <hi>France,</hi> under heavy penalties) and being taken in it: Who thereupon fell into an exceſſive ſadneſs and grief, retaining alſo ſuch an hatred againſt them that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her to this miſery, that ſhe could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded upon any terms to forgive them; whereby ſhe became uncapable of the Sacraments, in the extremity of her ſickneſs. Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> was brought to her, in the company of two or three other perſons, who talked with her a long time without any ſucceſs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that ſeeing whatever he ſaid prevailed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115611:103"/>fell upon his knees in the middle of the room, inviting the company to do the like; and after ſome few prayers, beſpake the ſick party, ſaying, and will not you joyn with us, to beg mercy of God? To which ſhe yielding, he cauſed her to repeat after him word by word, certain acts of repentance and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; by which ſhe found her minde ſo ſtrangely altered, that ſhe appeared quite another woman; and openly profeſſed, that ſhe did forgive them from her heart: And receiving with much meekneſs all his inſtructions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd herſelf to the worthy receiving of the Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>Being one day at the great Hoſpital in <hi>Paris,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the ſick how to diſpoſe themſelves for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Confeſſion; one of the Religious women in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to ſpeak with a perſon that was newly brought in thither; who had been without any cauſe at all, run thorow the body with a ſword, and was ſo incenſed againſt the party, that he could not indure with patience, any ſhould ſpeak of forgiving him. But no ſooner did Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> urge to him, the duty of a good Chriſtian in ſuch a caſe, with other ſpeeches to pacifie and ſweeten his ſpirit, but he was appeaſed, and ſaid, he forgave him with all his heart; adding, that he was ready both to ſee and embrace him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing moreover, very much ſenſe of Piety.</p>
                     <p>Certain Abbots, and other Eccleſiaſticks of quality and vertue met at <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> to ſettle a Miſſion: Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> who was very intimately acquainted with the moſt part of them, came to viſit them; where, according to his uſual cuſtom, without ſpeaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to any one, he went to the priſon, and meeting there with a moſt obſtinate ſinner, who had continued ſo along time, and neither by intreaty nor threatning,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115611:103"/>by fair means nor foul, nor by any other means which the Miſſion could uſe, be brought to Confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>The Miſſion ſending for Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> to dine with them, word was brought, after much ſearch for him, that they might happily meet with him at the Priſon; where he was found ſitting at the table with the Priſoners, for whom he had provided a dinner, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing lovingly with them, comforting and ſtirring them up to a good life. Amongſt the reſt, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid party in particular, upon whom he had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſign; to whom he ſpake with ſo much power, dealing with him ſo diſcreetly, or divinely rather, that he brought him to his bent, working in him a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion effectually to change his life, and make a good confeſſion of all his ſins: which gave a juſt occaſion to one of the Miſſion to ſay, That Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed that in three days, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> others would have had much ado to have brought about in three years.</p>
                     <p>I omit many others of the like kinde, concluding with this one, which ſeems very remarkable. He was requeſted to viſit a devout woman, who was tormented with exceſſive pains both inward and outward, and had great need of comfort and direction; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo great relief from his inſtructions, that within ſome few days ſhe writ as followeth, The effect which I found by the conference I had with this worthy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, was ſuch, that as ſoon as I had gotten victory over my ſelf to ſpeak, and lay open my heart unto him, ſtraightway my bleſſed Saviour communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his goodneſs ſo powerfully to me, that I was even peirced by the effects of his preſence: I found alſo a very particular aſſiſtance from the bleſſed Virgin, whom this holy man did invoke at the beginning of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115611:104"/>our diſcourſe. And I can aſſure you of a truth, that I was ſenſible of much comfort and eaſe of my affliction; inſomuch, that his ſpeeches had ſo great an influence upon my ſoul, and wrought ſo effectually that I have continued ever ſince in a good condition. And though my pains are not abated, yet I finde ſuch an alteration in my ſelf, that I ſeem to be no more my own, but all that is within me, breatheth after nothing but the Execution of the will of God, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his good pleaſure at any rate. And though nature ſuffers ſome difficulty in it, yet ſhe muſt now learn to yield to grace, and make reſiſtance no longer. My torments are not changed, and yet I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to ſuffer nothing, becauſe I am very well content to ſuffer: And although my inferiour ſenſitive part is much pained, yet my ſuperiour part cannot; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is it capable of ſuffering, by reaſon of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the will of God. All my care, during this time of reſignation of my ſelf to ſufferings, is to make good uſe of my affliction, and endeavour after ſolid vertue, with a perfect abandoning of my ſelf to the will of God.</p>
                     <p>Behold here the bleſſings of God upon his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, for the good of his neighbours; which working ſuch ſtrong impreſſions upon their hearts, to bring them to God, almoſt always accompanied his labours: At which indeed we ought not much to wonder, if we conſider him as a happy inſtrument, faſtened and united to the Lord of hearts, and Saviour of ſouls; ſingly aiming at the glory of God, and good of others, and ſparing nothing he conceived neceſſary thereunto. To which purpoſe his cuſtom was, before he undertook any ſuch buſineſs, to give himſelf up to our Lord (they are his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115611:104"/>own words) to ſpeak by his Spirit, and in his Power.</p>
                     <p>And this Lord (who deſireth infinitely the ſalvation of man) finding him ſo well diſpoſed, and fitted to his hand, uſed him for noble imployments, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with ſuitable graces and favours, even to work wonders. Which may ſerve both for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and ſhame of ſuch, who by their calling are deſigned for the procuring of the ſalvation of men, and yet through their own fault, do it with ſo little profit.</p>
                     <p>I finde moreover, that God gave him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beforehand knowledge and foreſight into the affairs which he would have him do, thereby to prepare him to undertake them without fear, and to acquit himſelf well therein. Being at his houſe in <hi>Citry,</hi> at the latter end of the year, 1642. he had a ſecret inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from God, that at his return to <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſhould finde a new imployment about the poor, and ſhould be much taken up therein: Which fell out according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; two days after his arrival there, certain perſons coming to advice with him, about a courſe to relieve ſuch poor as were aſhamed to beg, throughout that City, intreating him to take it into his care; which he did accordingly, undertaking for his ſhare, to viſit the fourth part, and diſtribute there alms according to their neceſſities, which was a ſufficient employment for one man, to take up his whole time, though he had no other buſineſs; which yet he performed, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the multitude of his other occupations; ſo that we may ſay, that according to humane reaſon, and without a ſpecial aſſiſtance from God, he could never have been able to have done and ſuffered ſuch great matters: But God, who hath given us a limited ſtrength of body and minde, can as eaſily heighten them, when, and how he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:115611:105"/>
                     <p>One day he ſaid to one of his great Confidents with much humility and devotion:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have been this night bathed all over in tears, by a view which our Lord hath given me.</hi> At which words making a ſtand, remaining ſometime recollected in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and tranſported with that grace he had received; afterward he went on, ſaying, <hi>that whilſt he was at prayer, he underſtood that there was a great imployment aſſigned him for new</hi> France <hi>in the</hi> Indies.</p>
                     <p>Which afterward fell out, and chiefly in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Church in the Iſland of <hi>Mont-real:</hi> In which noble deſign, other pious perſons, whom God had choſen thereunto, joyning with him; He by his cares; counſels, credit, and liberality both of his own, and what he begg'd from others, was highly ſerviceable.</p>

                     <p>THough this great ſervant of God, had an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faculty in aſſiſting all men for the good of their ſouls; yet was he more eminently happy, in ſome particular choice perſons, to whom our Saviour had aſſigned him, for the curing of their imperfections, to make them march on apace, and that thorow the narrow way of vertue and perfection. But becauſe the greateſt number of theſe are yet living, whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty I dare not offend, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething onely of ſome who are dead; and chiefly of one perſon, which may ſerve as a taſte of all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>This was the Counteſs of <hi>Chaſtres;</hi> who being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the affections of this world, according to the cuſtom of moſt young Ladies of her quality; it pleaſed God, out of his infinite love to her, to bring her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her death, from thoſe vanities, and conduct her by the thorny ſtrait-way, to the paths of vertue and high perfection; for which great work Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> was aſſigned from God: He inſpiring the one, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt aſſiſtance and counſel, and the other to afford it; and this with ſo happy ſucceſs, that within leſs than a years ſpace, her advancement herein was ſo notable, that he himſelf was aſtoniſhed at it: For in that ſhort time, ſhe became ſo perfectly diſingaged from all thoſe petty conveniences and accomodations, which our Ladies (flattering themſelves) pretend ſtill to have need of; that one preſenting her with ſomething of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115611:106"/>that nature, wherein ſhe had formetly taken delight, ſhe returned this anſwer, which may ſerve for a good leſſon to us all (eſpecially if we conſider, that ſhe was well known, to be of a very delicate, tender complexion, and very ſickly) how apt we are to multiply neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I thank God, I have quitted this, and far more other things. for the love of God, and yet finde no want at all, It is true, that nature of her ſelf is dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and prone to flatter her ſelf, upon the pretence of neceſſities, which ſhe is willing to apprehend much greater than truly they are; and often maketh them ſuch, by her imagination.</p>
                     <p>God indued him with great grace and light, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern her proper way, and to perſwade her to follow it; to advance her in the pathes of ſolid vertue, and to teach her by degrees to dye to herfelf; to ſupport her in great interior afflictions, and to inſtruct her very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, in what was moſt proper for her preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; he being accompliſhed with all the qualities of a fit Director, and ſhe on her part, perfectly reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up herſelf, to believe what he ſaid, and force her ſelf to put it in execution: A thing very requiſite in thoſe, that reſolve to make uſe of the conduct of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to good purpoſe. She received his counſel, with all the reſignation ſhe could, imagining our Saviour to ſpeak to her by his mouth; which really was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, if we duly conſider the paſſage I ſhall now relate.</p>
                     <p>The Lady ſpeaking to him one day, about procuring ſome relief of a moſt preſſing exceſſive pain, with which her ſpirit was afflicted; and not finding any comfort from whatſoever he ſaid, ſhe was moved to caſt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down upon her knees, to deliver up her own will
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115611:106"/>to our Saviour, and by a perfect reſignation, to enter into what deſigns his good pleaſure had decreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her; which ſhe did accordingly: And after riſing from her knees, ſhe no more beheld Monſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> but in him our B. Saviour, ſhining with a very great ſplendor, &amp; ſaying to her, do what my ſervant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects thee: Which words, at that very inſtant, wrought ſuch a wholeſome and divine effect upon her, that her pain vaniſhed, ſhe remaning filled with God, in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perfect tranquillity of ſpirit, accompanied with a lively repentance for her ſins, and an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, and of herſelf.</p>
                     <p>Though this happy intercourſe betwixt him and this Lady, accompanied with ſuch ſignal bleſſings from God, had contracted a ſtrict and perfect amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, yet he was very wary, wiſe, and reſerved in his addreſſes, viſiting her onely when the work of God did require, and making no longer ſtay nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with her, than what was preciſely neceſſary: Which the Lady thinking to be a little harſh, bemoan'd to a friend, whom ſhe knew to have ſome power with this holy man, in theſe words, Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> doth extreamly mortifie me with his civilities and reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I have great need to ſee him often, and yet cannot obtain it: yea, when we are together, he will not ſit down, except it be when I am ſick, or that I am not able to ſtand any longer; and always with his hat in his hand. I beſeech you tell him, what out of that great reſpect I owe him, I dare not my ſelf, what pain and inquietude I ſuffer, to ſee ſuch his carriage toward me, who ought be continually under his feet.</p>
                     <p>The party acquainted him with thus much, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this anſwer:</p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:115611:107"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I proceed in this manner, becauſe my duty to God, and to the Counteſs of</hi> Chaſtres <hi>require it; and moreover, ſince my Saviour doth oblige me to treat with her, I muſt do no more than what is neceſſary, and ſo retire, to which this posture is moſt convenient. If we ſit down, we ſhould forget our ſelves, and talk more than is needful, and perhaps paſs on to things unprofitable: Wherefore we both ought to ſtand upon our guard. I being a lay man and a ſinner, do not ſpeak to her but with great confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though I know it to be the will of God, and am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by ſeveral pious and judicious men, that it is my duty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe that undertake the conduct of ſouls, ought ſeriouſly to ponder this prudent anſwer, and perſwade themſelves, that the buſineſs conſiſts not in ſpeaking much to them, but in diſpoſing them to ſpeak to God, and in making them fit for God to ſpeak to them; to beget in their ſouls the ſubſtantial Word, his Son: And after wholeſome counſel given, conſonant to their ſtate and diſpoſition, in putting them upon its execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with good courage; vertue conſiſting not in words, but deeds.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have the courſe he took in directing this Lady; who thereby arrived to great perfection, making moſt excellent uſe of all her great ſufferings of body and minde; attaining to ſo great contempt of the world, that ſhe dyed with a deſign (notwithſtanding her great infirmities and ſickneſs) to become a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meline, in the Monaſtery of <hi>Beaulne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that we may have a taſte of his skill in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting ſeveral other perſons of great vertue, let us
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115611:107"/>conſider theſe following Rules of great Perfection, which he gave to them; and which, without doubt, were drawn from his owne private obſervation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have proteſted in the preſence of the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I will live according to the Maxims and Counſels of Jeſus Chriſt; and to that end:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Never to deſire or endeavour, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, to increaſe my fortune in riches or honour, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſent to any advantages, which my friends would procure for me, unleſs in obedience to, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of my Ghoſtly Father and Director of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To ſtudy the contempt and hatred of worldly riches and honours, to ſpeak of them no longer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity; and for the better eſtabliſhing of its Maxims in my ſoul, to avoid, as much as I can, the converſation of ſuch, as are guided by contrary Rules.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To entertain no Suit in Law, either as Plaintiff or Defendant, until all poſſible ways have been uſed for an accommodation, without any humane reſpect: In which I will ſubmit to advice.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To cut off all ſuperfluities, as well in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth my own perſon, as my family, that I may be the better enabled to aſſiſt the poor: For the better execution whereof, I will once every Moneth, after Communion, examine my ſelf therein, as ſtrictly, as if I were then to give an account to God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Never to conteſt, but to yield to all the world, as much as I can, both in point of Honour, Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115611:108"/>and of Opinion, Diſpute, and of another Will, which I ought to prefer before my own.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To ſhun all delicacies, not to do, or deſire any thing, upon the motive of pleaſure; nor to admit of any ſuch thing, unleſs it be joyned with neceſſity, or condeſcention to my neighbour, or the health of my body, or the refreſhment and relaxation of Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. To bear with patience, Contempt, Injuries, Contradictions, Loſſes, Oppreſſions and Affronts.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. To do all, that with diſcreet zeal I can, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der others from offending God, or blaſpheming his Holy Name, or detracting or ſlandering their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. To avoid and reject all kinde of tenderneſs and delicacy for the eaſe of the body; yea, to diminiſh and cut off, as much as I can, ſuch commodities and conveniences as may be forborn, without danger of health.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. To receive with all readineſs and charity the requeſts of my neighbour, and to ſupply his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in what I can poſſibly, by my ſelf, or by others.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. To perform the duty of Fraternal correption, with all Charity and Humility, in the moſt prudent manner I can, and to receive it moſt willingly from others.</p>
                     <p n="12">12, Once every Moneth, at leaſt, I will examine my ſelf upon the faults I have committed againſt theſe preſent Reſolutions: And once a year many may meer together, to renew this Proteſtation, and adviſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the way and means to accompliſh it.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WE muſt of neceſſity confeſs, that the knowledge of Interior things is moſt difficult, and that the diſcerning of Spirits, is, without contradiction, the moſt obſcure of all Sciences: And to be acquainted therewith, requires eminent grace from God, and a light no leſs, than what flows from the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: For, if the skill of curing the body be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and onely conjectural, by reaſon that we are guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein by Exterior Signs, which often prove am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous and equivocal (whereupon the moſt, expert Phyſicians, finde themſelves frequently miſtaken, and preſcribe quite contrary remedies) how much more muſt the skill of governing Souls, in the matter of their ſalvation, which are ſpiritual and remote from ſenſe, yea, and ſupernatural, be attended with great difficulties, and involved in wonderful obſcurity.</p>
                     <p>But Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> proved very skillful herein, having received a wonderful light from God, to ſearch out the myſterious ſecrets, and underſtand the moſt abſtruſe windings of Souls, in which his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was no ſmall advantage to him: His more than ordinary light ſerved him to diſcern truth from falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the ſafe from dangerous, the motions of a good ſpirit, from thoſe of the evil one, to bring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted ſouls to their repoſe, to fortifie and en ourage them, to diſengage them from all worldly things; &amp; to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115611:109"/>unite them to our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and by him to the Divinity, to be guided in all things by his holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall here preſent you with a taſte of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent skill, and ſome beams of this Divine light in theſe matters, which I found amongſt his Papers, under his own hand, which may give great inſight into the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a Spiritual life.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt is the elevation and groaning of the</hi> Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, <hi>who begin at the</hi> Purgative <hi>way.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt are exerciſed in the renouncing of ſin, and the vanities of the world, in bewatilng their former life, and ſeeking God, ſending forth from the depth of fear and revexence, their groans and ſighs to him, which is the beginning of life eternal.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Believers ſeek after the knowledge of his will, by his Word, which is his Son, deſiring to conform their lives after his example, who is our Way, our Life and Truth: And this is the progreſs of this life. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect groan in the preſence of God, after an Union with him, in imitation of our Saviour, exerciſing it by acts of love, and ſo fulfilling the firſt and great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which conſiſteth the perfection of our life here below.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>There are ſome Souls in the firſt eſtate, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſin, and quitting the vanities of the world, receive great ſenſible conſolations from God, and taſte raviſhing delights. But if they endeavour not to paſs on to the ſecond, to underſtand and practiſe the will of God in his Son, the Devil will ſoon deceive them by this bait, cauſing them to reſt in the complacency of theſe guſts: So that not making progreſs in Chriſt, who is their way, they will wander into by-paths, to the danger of a precipice: Their condition being a kinde of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, floating ſelf-denial, and deſire to be for God, to do his will, and love him with a falſe Interior peace, upon which they reſt, and whence afterwards, they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a very dangerous condition, becauſe they are not truly grounded upon Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath appointed for our ſole Guide.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But if after they are thus purged from the groſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the world, they be not likewiſe purified from themſelves, giving up all to Chriſt Jeſus, with a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſolution to imitate him, and enter into his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Self-annihilation: Inſtead of receiving the Spirit of God, they ſhall confirm themſelves in their own; and forming to themſelves falſe illuminations, ſhall be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their own ſenſe, and by what their own corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuggeſts to them, as glittering and pleaſing, with great danger of falling headlong into the errours of the Enthuſiaſts; who perſwade themſelves, that every thing that occurs to their phanſie, comes from God: Out of an opinion, that they neither will, nor ſeek, nor love any thing but God, and ſo become little or nothing at all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the checks of their own Conſcience.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>If you obſerve thoſe that begin their Spiritual life in this manner, you will finde them to have little faith or
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115611:110"/>dependance on Chriſt Jeſus. And if you ask them what they deſire, or whetherto they tend? they will anſwer in general, To whatſoever God will have. It will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſet theſe right, and if they be not too far gone with theſe guſts, and ſenſible conſolations, to carry them to deſine indeed what God will have, but deſire it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the model of our Saviour, and the precepts of his Goſpel (which he hath left us as his Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be our Light, and the Rule of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightnings.)</hi>

In which notwithſtnading, the decaitful ſpirit of Nature and the Devil, play their game, under the mask of theſe dark illuminations, of theſe falſe peaces, of theſe quaint terms, high words, and myſterious notions, of theſe volumes of ſpiritual writings (the fruits whereof are for the moſt part in the paper) from whence it is ſeen ſo often, that thoſe who have begun well, and with much purity, do fall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into groſs faults; whilſt Property and Self-pleaſing steal into the ſoul in the room of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we have his inſight into ſpiritual things, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing the great advancement of his illuminated Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which God had enlightned in more than an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, declaring unto him the deſigns he had upon ſouls: Giving him to penetrate into the obſcureſt receſſes of their Conſciences, and to diſcover what was moſt ſecret and hidden, to ſpeak with words not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and premeditated, but which were inſpired, and put into his mouth at that hour, which proved moſt powerful and effectual.</p>
                     <p>In the year, 1644. A maid, whom God had indued with pious affections, was deſirous to become a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meline. She communicated her intentions to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> begging his advice. Who at firſt, finding ſome difficulties in the buſineſs, judged it fitting for her, to think no more of it. Notwithſtanding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, God inſpired him at his prayers with a very great certitude, that it was his will, ſhe ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the buſineſs, maugre all difficulties, pointing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115611:112"/>out to him the very place where the thing ſhould be done. He informed her thereof, which ſhe hearkned unto, with due reſpect, as if Chriſt himſelf had ſpoken unto her, and commanded her to enter into that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, where ſhe remains at this very day.</p>
                     <p>In the year, 1647. having viſited a perſon afflicted with great pains, who had need of ſuch a man as he, he writ thus to his Director:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have been with the party you know of, and have told her what I thought convenient to her condition. Our Saviour enlightned me to diſcover to her, his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure concerning her, how that this ſad and dark condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not ſent, to bring her to a ſtand and trouble at it, but to facilitate her way to perfection, and carry her without amuſement, to our Saviour Chriſt Leſus, who is our Sanctification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I acquainted her, how we ought to lay this ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that our ſelves are nothing, but infirmity and miſery it ſelf: So that when any one tells us thereof, he tells us no news: And that God from this inſufficiency of our ſelves to all good, means to extract that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertue of Humility and Diffidence of our ſelves, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging us thereby to go to his Son our Saviour, to finde ſtrength in him, and remedy for all our miſeries. I was much enlarged upon each thing which ſhe told me; and God gave her ſo great a plenitude of light and grace, that ſhe ſpake marvellous things touching the operation of the Holy Trinity in her, with other excellent notions, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting a very particular aſsistance of his Divine Grace. In this eſtate I left her.</hi>

                     <p>Concerning himſelf he addes thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As concerning my ſelf, I have not much to ſay, onely I finde within my ſelf, through the mercy of God, a great tranquility in his preſence, through the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, and ſuch an inward experience of Eternal Life, as I am not able to expreſs. And this is that, whither I am moſt bent and drawn: Yet I finde my ſelf ſo ſtrangely naked and barren, that I wonder at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I am in, and by which I diſcourſe: For in my addreſſes to this party, I begun my ſpeech, not knowing how to purſue it; and after the ſecond ſentence, I had not the leaſt foreſight of what ſhould be the third, and ſo of the reſt: Not but that I ſeem to have a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the things I ſpeak in ſuch a manner as I am capable of it: But I onely utter what is given me, and in the ſame way as it is communicated, I communicate it to others. Which done, there ſeems to remain nothing in me, but the foundation from whence it ſprings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He grew to ſo high a reputation in this knowledge of ſoul matters, joyned with extraordinary graces, that many Eccleſiaſtical perſons, and many Superiors of Religious Orders, and well governed Communities, thought themſelves very happy in communicating with him, and following his advice, in matters of great weight; being aſſured by undoubted ſigns, that he was repleniſhed by the Spirit of God. And very many, both Eccleſiaſticks and Seculars, of each Sex and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, even ſuch as were arrived to great perfection, ſent to receive his inſtruction and aſſiſtance, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their ſpiritual affairs.</p>
                     <p>In the year, 1641. he began particularly to apply
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115611:113"/>himſelf to this way: But of all the imployments our Saviour call'd him to for his ſervice, there was none wherein he met with more pain, or more contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Spirit, than in this, judging himſelf moſt unworthy and uncapable, reſolving to proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it, notwithſtanding his ſeveral impulſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, without asking counſel: Which counſel, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good examination of the buſineſs, was this, that he ought to undertake it, and that it was the will of God. To which he ſubmitted with exceeding great confuſion and ſhame in himſelf, manifeſted by his countenance, words and behaviour, in his communication with the parties that asked his advice, yielding to their requeſts with very great humility and reverence; as all thoſe can witneſs who knew him: And they likewiſe aſſuring themſelves, that God reſided, ſpake, and acted in him, and by him, remained in his preſence with great reſpect, and relied moſt confidently upon his conduct.</p>
                     <p>And God made it evident, by his bleſſing and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſucceſs upon his endeavours, that his actings herein were perfectly agreeable to his will: Teaching us hereby, that he hath no need of us for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his deſigns; and that he ſerves himſelf of whom he thinks good, and many times of ſuch a one, whom he findes well diſpoſed, paſſing by thoſe whom their vices render uncapable: And the beſt preparation to be imployed by God in great affairs, is, to abandon our ſelves wholly to his deſigns, and become very little in his own eſteem, as this holy man was.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>UNdoubtedly a mans outward compoſure, and the whole oeconomy of his converſation, is of great conſequence in the ſervice of our neighbours, either to further or hinder our deſign for their ſalvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which onely lies open to the eye, and makes the firſt and ſtrongeſt impreſſion upon their ſpirits; and either wins, or alienates them, according as it is well or ill ordered.</p>
                  <p>Whence it came to paſs, that Monſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> who had an ardent deſire to aſſiſt his neighbour, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to that purpoſe at any rate, whatever might be requiſite thereto; did whatever he could, for the well compoſing of his exterior, keeping his demeanor, geſtures, motions, looks, words, ſilence, and other parts of his Converſation, in ſuch a harmony, as he conceived moſt ſuitable to draw his neighbor to God: which he managed with ſuch advantage, that we may ſay with truth, and the allowance of all that knew him, that in this point of good outward comportment, he was admirable, and that no man of long time hath been ſeen to go beyond him.</p>
                  <p>He was very modeſt, always calm, and inviolably equal. Amongſt all the things which I have obſerved in the deceaſed Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> (ſaith a ſufficient witneſs, who was iutimately acquainted with him) his rare modeſty, and great equality in his behavior and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115611:114"/>deportment, gave me the firſt and moſt pregnant Idea's of his Sanctity. There was ſomething in his looks, that carried ſo much reverence in it, that one might eaſily judge thereby, that he was always actually in the preſence of God.</p>
                  <p>In every place, condition, employment whatſoever, the ſame in his looks, geſture, words and actions, whether alone, or in company, with friends or ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, rich or poor, before his children or ſervants, yea, even before his Lacquey, in the field or town, at the table, and every where.</p>
                  <p>We may freely avouch, that compleatly Maſter of himſelf he muſt be, that poſſeſſeth ſuch an immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: At which it is impoſſible for any to arrive, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth not himſelf continually to the preſence of God, and hath not abſolutely conquered his paſſions and interiour motions: For eaſie it is, amongſt ſo many encounters, which daily preſent themſelves from without, to have our ſpirit diſcompoſed, put out of frame, and be tranſported, and diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>over its irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities by cholar, word or geſture, or ſome other ſign.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch a conſtant equality is more admirable, when it is found in ſuch a perſon as Monſieur <hi>de Renty,</hi> who was not Phlegmatick by Complexion, but Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, hot, and of an active ſpirit; but the exact and perpetual care, force and watch, that he had over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, held and preſerved him in this Exteriour deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo excellent, and divine, and ſo ſuitable to one that is to work good upon others.</p>
                  <p>That which pleaſeth me moſt in him (ſaith another very credible perſon in a Memorial) was the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, and intimate union with God: attended with ſuch a marvellous peace and trancuillity of minde,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115611:114"/>that it ſhined forth in his countenance, and begat a kinde of devotion in the beholders. This union me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, was ever in him, without any ſign of diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, any levity, any word not neceſſary, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in company, or any humane reſpect, ever forced him to ſcatter his ſpirit, or to quit his union with God; not but that he was moſt full of civility, but ſo, as to look more within himſelf than without.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, this continual preſence of God (ſaith the ſame perſon) did ſo take him up, that no accident, object, or any thing rare or extraordinary, could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him. I never ſaw him admire thoſe things the world uſually doth, nor fix his eyes upon any curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatſoever. His gate in the ſtreets was in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected, modeſt, and equal manner, without gazing here and there, that a man might ſee Jeſus Chriſt was his way, his employment, his all, and nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p>Being one day importuned by a friend, out of curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to go ſee a great Perſonage, eſteemed for a Saint, and to have the gift of miracles. He replied with his wonted ſweetneſs, Our Saviour is in all Churches in the B. Sacrament, and him we may viſit.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing the buſineſs of ſpeech and ſilence, make up a great part in a good or bad converſation; let us ſee how this holy man, ſo zealous of his neighbours ſalvation, behaved himſelf in both.</p>
                  <p>He was very reſerved in his ſpeech, and that both from nature and grace, and indeed he could not have been ſo prudent a man, had he been a much ſpeaker; ſince the Scripture makes it the proper character of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to ſpeak little; and, that in the multitude of words, there ſhall not want ſin.</p>
                  <p>In the entercourſe of viſits, and all Aſſemblies of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115611:115"/>Devotion, where it concerned him to ſpeak, he did it in his courſe, with a minde and demeanour intent and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecollected, with words ſhort, but material. He was never ſeen forward or eager to ſpeak, or in ſpeaking, or to do it with a higher tone than ordinary, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was his haſte, if he made any report, or gave ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of buſineſs, he did it ſo briefly, and in words onely neceſſary and pertinent, that a very hard matter it would be (as one ſaid of him) to finde one that ſpake better, and yet leſs than he.</p>
                  <p>Things that were vain or unprofitable, or the news of the times, were never the ſubject of his diſcourſe, but always ſomething good, and the Kingdom of God, in imitation of our Saviour; and where this diſcourſe was diverted to worldly buſineſs or trifles, he either took leave of the company, or ſtole away, without ſaying any thing.</p>
                  <p>And when he talk'd even of good things, it was with moderation; ſaying, that there was much need of ſparingneſs and ſobriety, when we ſpeak of God and good things; and that it was one of the greateſt amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that troubled him, when he was amongſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual perſons, to hear them often ſpend precious time, in talking of vertue at large, and without ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from ſuch Conferences with dry, empty, and diſſipated ſpirits: Whereas the ſecret of Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, conſiſts not in ſpeaking, but in doing, and that ſubſtantial word of God is onely one, and this ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently efficacious, to produce the holy Spirit, and in its unity, to work marvellous things.</p>
                  <p>His converſation moreover, was in a true and high manner humble, reſpective, affable, officious, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, and cordial; Patient he was, in ſuffering the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115611:115"/>ignorances, rudeneſſes, imperfections, croſs humors, and other faults of his neighbours; prudent in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to their diſpoſitions, and paſſing by many ſmall matters, without ſeeming to take notice of them at all.</p>
                  <p>And ſo profitable and edifying was his demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that wherever he came, his very looks and modeſty, his words, his ſilence, and all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior comportment, caſt forth a fragrancy and ſweet perſume of Vertue, Devotion and Piety, and made a good impreſſion upon the ſpirits of others. His very preſence charmed many into recollection; the very ſight of him was enough to bridle any, and his acquaintance have confeſt, that their knowing that he was in the Church, hath wrought more attention in them at their prayers; and ſome of them, eight days after their having enjoyed his company, have felt in themſelves the effects of grace, in an extraordinary attraction and devotion towards God.</p>
                  <p>Whereſoever he came, he was flock'd unto from all parts, out of that reverend eſteem they had of him, and the deſire of thoſe conſolations they were ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, in his preſence. Notwithſtanding, when he perceived any value ſet upon himſelf, or any applauſe of what he did or ſaid, he was deeply humbled in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, teſtifying by his carriage the diſcontent of his ſoul, hanging down his head, caſting down his eyes with deep ſilence, during ſuch commendations, with a grave and ſet demeanor, expreſſing his inward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which begot reſpect and edification in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,</p>
                  <p>For concluſion, I ſhall adde one thing very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and which ſhews how perfect and accompliſhed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115611:116"/>he was in his converſation, namely this, that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way and faſhion of converſe, of dealing and treating with others, and of his devotion, was not check'd, blamed or condemned by any, but approv'd, priz'd and commended: ſo that generally all had him in eſteem, reverence and love, and ſaid of him in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as was ſaid of his Maſter Chriſt, <hi>He hath done all things well.</hi> Such a general approbation as this, and in one that dealt in ſo many and difficult bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, muſt needs be very rare, and argue a moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and adviſed ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>And as theſe things got approbation, ſo his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his honeſty, his reſpect to each one, even the loweſt, his affability, charity, patience, and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, gained him the hearts of all; yet as it is a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing to be ſo much eſteemed, praiſed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by all, ſo God, by a wiſe and divine counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pois, to ſecure his vertue, and keep him from tripping in ſo ſlippery a way, did permit, that from whence he ſhould have received the moſt eſteem, approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſatisfaction, to wit, from the Lady his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he found the quite contrary, and that in a way moſt ſtrange and afflictive to him, as we have ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is without contradiction, that few men in <hi>Paris,</hi> or in all <hi>France,</hi> were ſo much imployed as he, in the affairs that concerned the ſervice of God. For which he was furniſhed with great ſtrength of body and minde, to manage ſo great and ſeveral buſineſſes without difficulty, with great tranquility, order, and content; husbanding his time to the beſt advantage, diſparching one ſpeedily after another, and ſometimes many together. He hath been ſeen to do three things together, without trouble or miſtake. And at other times (when preſſed with many diſpatches at once) to read Letters, give Audience, and write Anſwers to different perſons, all at the ſame time, of which he hath quitted himſelf handſomely and well.</p>
                  <p>In one of his Letters, he wrote thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is very true, that buſineſs findes me out from all parts; inſomuch, that I am often inforced to read, write, and do buſineſs all at a time. A little aſſiſtance would do well, though I have many ſharers; however, let not that trouble you, for I diſpatch as much at preſent as I can, the reſt in due time, without encombring my ſelf therewith. Our Saviour doth gratiouſly beſtow on me a peace of minde in all this, ſo that I am not at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:115611:117"/>
                  <p>His order was, ſeriouſly to conſider of things, before any reſolution; and if after his own ſenſe given (to which he was not at all eſpouſed) he found anothers reaſon to be better, he quitted his own. A thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary to men of buſineſs, yet rare to be found: ſince if we take not heed, we all idolize our own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and falling in love with our private light, are dſirous to be leading men, affecting to ſee our own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions crowned.</p>
                  <p>Having compoſed rules for a Society of Pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and digeſted them thorowly, he preſented them to be examined by ſome vertuous perſons, from whom he admitted with great humility, ſome corrections, cancelling them with his own hand, requeſting that they might be put in other terms, more proper than his own.</p>
                  <p>After he had reſolved on any thing, he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf prompt, firm, and conſtant for the execution; not quitting it, till he had brought it to the end it ſhould be. Not like thoſe, who hot at firſt, grow preſently cold, and begin many things well, but finiſh nothing. Sometime when he had brought a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fair way to perfection, he committed it to a friend to finiſh; not out of any inconſtancy of ſpirit, but to gain time for the undertaking and doing of more: And withal, that herein he might avoid the honour of it. Out of his great humility, paſſing that to another, which would exerciſe his humility, in letting another have the praiſe, which redounds more to him that happily ends a good thing, than to him that begins it.</p>
                  <p>In all affairs that concerned the ſervice of God, he had an unmoveable conſtancy, and undaunted courage,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115611:117"/>never flagging or yielding up himſelf. And beſides the force of his words, there appeared in his countenance an extraordinary aſſurance (although his ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment was always ſweet and quiet) which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly appeared in all meetings; where he manifeſted ſo much ſpirit, and God inveſted him with ſuch a force, that thoſe that beheld him, felt themſelves ſtruck with an awful reſpect. When he ſpake and gave his opinion, his propoſals carried ſo much light in them, his judgement ſo much ſolidity, his reaſons ſo great force (he taking every thing in its due place, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving each juncture of time) that all were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to acquieſs in his determination.</p>
                  <p>But if any approved not of his advice, or diſputed his reaſons, he knew how to inforce them with ſuch arguments, eſpecially where he had any authority in the Aſſembly, that at length they yielded. But if they chanced to make another reply, he gave not one word more, but his very ſilence, and the ſteadineſs of his countenance, and his other carriage, reſtrained any further diſpute. And the meeting ended, he would go to that party, and crave his pardon with great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: Sweetly informing him, that what he aimed at, was not to make good his own opinion, but for the cauſe of God, to which by duty he was obliged: But in other things, that he was moſt ready to yield to every one.</p>
                  <p>We meet daily with thoſe ſpirits, that are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant in buſineſs, doing and undoing every hour, very indeciſive and mutable: But he was of another temper, quick-ſighted to penetrate into a buſineſs, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious to determine it, and conſtant not to vary in a reſolution well grounded; ſo that his word was his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115611:118"/>law, and was taken by others as current as an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>When his preſence was requeſted at any conſult, he would be punctual at the time appointed, that none ſhould ſtay for him: Where taking his place (and that the loweſt, if it were poſſible) his demeaner was ſo modeſt, and compoſed, that all were edified by it. Liſtening to others with great attention and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if he had no other buſineſs. And after his opinion given, very brief and material: his preſence being no further uſeful, he would take leave; being a great husband of his time, ſince other buſineſs for Gods ſervice, ſtill attended him elſe where.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding the throng of buſineſs, and though never ſo important, he quitted not, for them, his Exerciſes of Piety, nor his care of perfection, which he preferred before all other his affairs; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as wholeſome meat, taken immoderately, doth hurt, and inſtead of ſtrengthening the ſtomach, weakens, and ſuffocates its natural heat: So theſe Exterior employments, even the moſt holy, if a man ſurcharge himſelf, bring much prejudice, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the ardour of Devotion. Wherefore he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to over-burthen himſelf with them, being very vigilant that they ſhould not diſtract and diſſipate him, nor quench the Interiour motions of the Spirit, nor ſecularize his ſoul, but ferve onely as means to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and unite him more to God.</p>
                  <p>In the multitude of buſineſs, he was ſtill recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as much alone in great meetings, as the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites in their ſolitudes: which might be gathered from his modeſtie, and compoſed countenance, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing his application to his Interiour, and his union
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115611:118"/>to God, from whom he drew light and ſtrength, for the managing and prudent ordering of theſe bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neſſes. One day he wrote thus to his Director:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My recollection hinders no buſineſs at all, but rather furthers it. For without it, I ſhould have a ſolicitous deſire of doing all my ſelf; whereas I act now in a moſt ſerene way, in which I have no ſhare; for it is our Lord that doth all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another Letter thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Finding my ſelf one day much burthened with divers-buſineſs, I had a deſire to draw off my minde wholly, and at the ſame inſtant I found it. Since which time they create me no trouble, and I diſpatch them more readily without thinking of them. This grace hath been often renewed to me (although in ſeveral manners) which I acknowledge to be very great becauſe it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves me diſingaged, even in the multiplicity of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding he never omitted any thing of prudence or induſtry, for the effecting his buſineſs, yet the ſucceſs he expected much more from Gods benediction, than from his induſtry, or any humane endeavours; knowing well, that what was undertaken for the ſervice of God, and good of his neighbour, was to be accompliſhed by his grace: Wherefore in every thing he had a great recourſe to prayer, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commending all his exerciſes to God, and in all imployments and choice of perſons which he made uſe of, his eye was more upon grace than nature, or any Exterior abilities.</p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:115611:119"/>
                  <p>And knowing that the affairs of God are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their difficulties, but meet with great oppoſitions, even ſometimes to be overturned, he was armed with patience in the undertaking, to ſuffer with courage, not ſtarting at the greateſt dangers, but ſtill hoping of the ſucceſs. If they miſcarried at any time, he reſted well ſatisfied, after all fair means attempted on his part. Thus he writ to a friend:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a great infirmity in our humane nature, that ſhe needs applauſe in matters of grace: Wherefore I look at it as a great favour from God, when I have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of executing any enterprize, ſolidly undertaken, and well approved of and acknowledged, to proceed from the Spirit of God, by thoſe to whom he hath committed in his Church the judgement of ſuch things; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the accompliſhment of it meets with many croſſes and contradictions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We may take up good and holy deſigns, and God doth often inſpire them; yet when he is pleaſed to permit a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary event, we muſt adore his ſecret will, which brings with it, more of mercy in the croſsing of them, than if they had ſucceded to our comfort. We ſhould always be jealous over our own ſpirit, that it fix not upon any thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſweet Jeſus hath his deſigns, which he conducts by ſuch means, as we would not at all make choice of; and the reaſon is, becauſe he would thwart our wills, and abate our dependancies upon earth: And therefore often thwarts he our juſt undertakings, being more
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115611:119"/>jeolous of the Sacrifice of our hearts, than of any thing elſe, how ſpecious ſoever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the principal rule which this holy man obſerved in theſe affairs was, never to look at them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but in the will and deſign of God, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in view of this. Whence it came to paſs, that he applied himſelf to buſineſs, not as appearing glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, pleaſant, or profitable, but as agreeable to the will of God, to which he ſubmitted his own; making poor and mean imployments equally conſiderable, and ſometime preferred before greater: Hence he took up things caſt aſide by others, undertook charities out of the road, and not taken notice of, applied himſelf to ſuch poor as were in a forlorn condition, believing, that herein there was leſs of nature, and more of grace: And never thruſt himſelf into a buſineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will of God, and when it did conſiſt with that, he was not haſty or precipitant, but let things go on kindly and ſweetly, according to the pace of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the courſe of his good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The like we have of him, in Memorials from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places: It was not his way, to begin or finiſh any thing, according to the motion of his own will, but of the Spirit of God, as far as he knew it. If after he had undertaken any thing, he felt his inward motion to ceaſe, he ceaſed alſo the purſuit. He had no private deſign or project wherby he ſteer'd (although he knew the things he had to do) but attended on the expreſs order from above; which he received either by a light in his underſtanding, or by an impreſſion in his will, or by ſome other way, that gave him as great a certitude, as any can have in the like occurrences wher
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115611:120"/>upon a familiar friend, asked him one day, whether he would do ſuch a thing at ſuch a time? He anſwered,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Know you not that to morrow is not mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And at another time he ſaid;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſee five or ſix things, which of neceſsity muſt be done; but I cannot tell you, which I would diſpatch the firſt, nor when, nor how, for through the mercy of God I am indifferent to all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He writ thus to his Director:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I hope to be at</hi> Paris <hi>about the end of</hi> September, <hi>where I ſhall receive your orders to come to you, when I may be leſt troubleſome: Where I ſhall be ready for what my Saviour ſhall appoint by you. I forecast nothing, but onely to obey and follow his conduct by your appointment, and in every thing the beſt I can: I finde by experience, that when I think to do moſt in any place, there I do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. This hath taught me to go diveſted of all deſign; and when I think leaſt thereof, and abandon my ſelf to God, then he doth the more; wherefore I will leave the doing to him, and to you in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Going one day in the holy Week, accompanied with a friend, to receive a moſt royal and liberal ſum of money given by the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> in behalf of the Church of <hi>Canada;</hi> and paſſing by a Church where they were ſinging the Divine Service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>diſpatch the will of God, it would be a great comfort to be preſent at the Church, to hear the praiſes of God; but let us paſs on, ſince this is more in concurrence with his holy will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:115611:120"/>
                  <p>The ſame party reported of him, that he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſeveral perſons wondring at his extraordinary recollection, and ſuch an intimate union with God, in one man, who had ſo great imployments, but he was above them all, affixed onely to God, and to the execution of his will.</p>
                  <p>He gave this counſel to a certain friend, who had great deſigns for the ſervice of God, but ſuch as at that time were not ſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us not apply the days buſineſs, but to the day. Your intentions are pious, but you muſt reſign the future to God, and be willing for the preſent, to love and follow what he makes appear to be his will, and to keep your ſelf ſtill before him as a ready Sacrifice, together with our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the concluſion of this Chapter, I ſhall produce a Letter to his Director, upon the ſame ſubject, in the year, 1648. full of light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will tell you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what paſſed yeſterday within me, by which you may underſtand my preſent condition: Hearing the Goſpel of the Aſſumption of our Lady, which ſpeaketh of</hi> Martha <hi>and</hi> Mary, <hi>moſt of the ſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I formerly had upon that ſubject came preſently into my minde; to wit, that prayer and converſe with God, are much to be preferred before all Exterior exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, though never ſo holy; ſeeing that</hi> Martha <hi>bufied about ſo holy and excellent a ſervice, was reprehended for her trouble, and</hi> Mary <hi>commended for her recoſe. This word,</hi> Turbaris erga plurima, Thou art troubled
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115611:121"/>about many things, <hi>hath beſteaded me along time, to draw me off from outward things, and alſo from inward, though good, if not abſolutely neceſſary, as viſiting and inſtructing the poor, or reading or writing ſomething of devotion, and the like: And I underſtood it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient at that time to quit them, the better to betake my ſelf to Interaloperations, and arrive at the laying down of our own will and vivacity, to attend wholly to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment, following it in prudent ſimplicity, by the Spirit of Chriſt, which enlivens and lives in thoſe that hearken to it with reſpect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But you muſt know, that for theſe three or four moneths which I have ſpent in Low</hi>-Normandy, <hi>I have been, as it were, continually imployed in Exteriour works; as conferring with all ſorts of people, taking care of the ſick that found me out, removing from place to place, reconciling differences, new building a great Church, which was to be pluck'd down and enlarged. For which I was forced to draw out ſeveral platforms, and make the very models (in which formerly I have had ſome inſight) by reaſon of the want of Architects in that place, calling to minde my old notions, and buſying my ſelf wholly in it. Yeſterday, after my mornings work, hearing the ſame Goſpel read, and theſe words in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> Turbaris erga plurima, Thou art troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout many things; <hi>a certain Interiour light came upon me, and it was ſaid unto me,</hi> Non turbaris erga pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Thou art not troubled about many things; <hi>giving me to underſtand, and that in a very evident manner, that the things we are employed upon according to the Divine order, whatſoever they be, do not create us any ſuch trouble, and I diſcovered clearly (at leaſt as I thought) that</hi> Martha <hi>was not reproved for doing a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115611:121"/>good work, but for doing it too ſolicitouſly. Our Saviour intimating to her by theſe words,</hi> Turbaris erga plurima, <hi>that her buſineſs was done in trouble and inordinate agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſpirit, though the end was very laudable. That the priucipal buſineſs conſiſts in hearing the Eternal Word, even as his own humanity, whether in working or preaching, or any other imployment, received its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Divinity.</hi> A me ipſo facio nihil, ſicut audio, hoec loquor, I do nothing of my ſelf, as I hear, that I ſpeak, <hi>ſaid he. In like manner ought we to take our directions from Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Word of Eternal Life, and act nothing with diſturbance, but all in peace by his Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I received hereby a great ſupport, in the performance of theſe petty Exterior offices, to which my duty obliged me, and made no difficulty at all, to yield up my ſelf, to this holily-diſordered Divine Order. In which I perceived, that it was Gods will I ſhould perform theſe petty things, which could not be done without me. For theſe three moneths I have not, it may be, ſpent three or four hours at my prayers upon my knees together, out of the Church; and ſhould I perform them at all, no otherwiſe than on this faſhion, I ſhould but very ill diſcharge my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115611:122"/>Virgin, the Angels and Saints, yea, and of the whole Heaven, if you will. Such a wonderful expanſion of ſoul can our Lord give, when, and how he pleaſeth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I enjoyed at the ſame time, ſuch a ſenſible impreſſion of God, yet excelling all ſenſe (as being acted in the more noble part of the Soul;</hi> viz. <hi>the Spirit) that if I had been thrown like a boul, I could never have loſt the ſight of my God. All things are here tranſitory, for our Lord turns this boul in a ſtrange manner, when it pleaſeth him. And theſe d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Having therefore perfectly learn'd this fundamental truth of Chriſtianity, his ſtudy was, to unite himſelf to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to copy him forth as his Rule and Law for the regulating of his Exterior and Interior; adoring him daily under this notion, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with great reſlection to his words, actions, deſigns, and the ſeveral myſteries, receiving from each of them great enlightnings. Thus he writ to me one day upon the myſterie of his Incarnation:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have had the grace divers times, very intimately to underſtand that ineffable myſterie, hidden with God from all ages, and manifested now to the Saints (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115611:124"/>to S.</hi> Paul) <hi>which is the alliance he hath contracted with us, in Jeſus Chriſt. This knowledge produceth in me as much aſtoniſhment as love. And (to tell you my ſenſe of it) a man poſſeſſed with theſe verities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more a man, but becomes annihilated, and all his deſire is to be loſt and melted, on purpoſe to change his nature, and enter into this Spirit of Jeſus, to act no leſs in him than by him.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I have conceived ſuch great things of our Saviours Humanity, united to the Divinity, as cannot be uttered. How hath this alliance of the Divinity, moſt deeply abaſed the ſacred Humanity into a ſelf-annihilation, and a ſacrifice of love, upon the ſight of the greatneſs of God? What an honour is this to the Humane Nature, to be thus predeſtinated? and, What a glory to us to be choſen and called to an entrance into his favour, and a riſing to God, and the everlaſting enjoyment thereof through him? It would ſpend me this whole day to write to you, the view that I have had of the wiſdom and bounty of God, touching this mysterie of Love, which he hath opened unto us in his Son.</hi>

Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> had a deſire to go to <hi>Beaulne,</hi> being but ſeven leagues from <hi>Dijon,</hi> to recommend himſelf to the prayers of this holy Virgin: And though when he came thither, he neither ſpake to her, nor ſaw her (ſhe having, by a particular conduct of our Saviour, been retired for thirteen years from the ſpeech of any ſecular perſon) yet notwithſtanding, he received much benefit from his journey; as he expreſſed in a Letter writ back from <hi>Dijon,</hi> to the Prioreſs of that place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I want words to expreſs the mercies I received by my journey to</hi> Beaulne. <hi>Siſter</hi> Margaret <hi>hath marked me out, in the holy Infant Jeſus, ſuch a diveſting of my ſelf of all worldly things, that it appears to me my rendezouz, where I muſt ſtrip my ſelf naked of all things elſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The year after, he made a ſecond journey; where God having altered her reſolution, for ſpeech and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with others, he had the happineſs to diſcourſe with her, and contracted at that time, a very intimate alliance of grace, receiving great gifts by means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The chiefeſt and ſource of all the reſt, being, that our Saviour engaged him, as he had done her, in a more particular devotion to the myſterie of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and imprinted in him the lineaments of the like Graces and Spirit.</p>
                  <p>This holy man (whoſe judgement may be highly
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115611:125"/>eſteemed by us, conſidering his extraordinary inſight into ſpiritual matters) greatly valued this Religious woman, approving exceedingly her directions, and teſtifying how great a bleſſing he reckoned her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and what benefit he had reaped from her, even after her death. To which purpoſe he writ thus to me the eighteenth of <hi>June.</hi> 1648. the year of her death.</p>

And that we ſhould make our addreſſes to all theſe myſteries, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our neceſſities; and therefore to tie our ſelves to one particular, were to ſend up maimed Devotions, and to limit the extent of Verity and Grace. After this, I went to receive the B. Sacrament, abandoning my ſelf wholly to my God, according to my uſual cuſtom. A little while after the Communion, I ſaw (by an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) our Saviour entire; that is, all his myſteries, from his Incarnation, to his ſtate of Glory, where he reſides at preſent, governing us. And in particular, the Greatneſs and Dignity of this myſterie of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; and withal, I was inſtructed, that this myſterie is our Port, and our Addreſs, for to obtain our Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in glory: That this is it, to which we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our ſelves, and here ſtay our thoughts, and that it would be temerity, to proceed to other myſteries on the ſame manner.

Finally, that we ought not preſently to addreſs our ſelves to thoſe other myſteries of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but onely to this of the Infancy, which brings us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ignorance, the ſeparation from, and in applacation of things of this life, making no further uſe of them, than as they are given us for neceſsity, which keeps us in great ſilence, and produceth a Mortification of the Exteriour man, whilſt the Interiour is buſied in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the moſt holy Soul of our Saviour, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally imploying it ſelf in looking up toward his Father, in his Love, in zeal of his Glory, in the Offering of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115611:128"/>that theſe words carry with them, the proof of that which I had contemplated three days before, of the right way and proceeding of this my Saviour, who in his Infancy humbled himſelf, even to the form of a ſervant, and all the reſt of his life, to death, being obedient to the Croſs, following the decrees of his Father, not by election, but by ſubmiſsion and patience. This ſecond view confirmed me further, and after another manner in this myſterie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Infancy therefore of our Saviour, is an eſtate, where we muſt dye to all things; and where the ſoul, in Faith, Silence, Reverence, Innocence, Purity and Simplicity doth attend and receive the orders of God, making it his daily work in Abnegation; neither looking before nor behinde, but being united to the holy Childe Jeſus: Who with an abſolute Reſignation, received or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from his Father, for his viſitation by the Shepherds and Wiſemen, for his Circumciſion, going up to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>flying into</hi> Egypt, <hi>his return back, his journey to</hi> Jordan <hi>to be baptized into the Wilderneſs to be tempted, for his Preaching; and finally, his Death upon the Croſs, Reſurrection, Aſcexſion, and Conſummation in Glory. Thus, Father, ought we, methinks, to follow Jeſus, our Model, in theſe ſteps, through the grace of this Infancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is it, he wrote to his Director, concerning this Myſterie, and why he choſe it before others; and which appears alſo in a Letter to another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For this reaſon, ought we to addreſs our ſelves to the Infancy, rather than the Croſs, or any other Myſterie, becauſe he emptied himſelf (as ſaith the Apoſtle) of his
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115611:129"/>own good pleaſure, and choſe the Manger, but not the Croſs, to which he was conducted by his obedience. To teach us, to chuſe, of our ſelves, Annihilation; and after, to ſuffer our ſelves willingly, as little children, to led into</hi> Egypt, <hi>the Deſart, the Croſs, and the Crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe ſolid enlightnings, relating to this Myſtery, he had moreover, others, touching the three Verrues of Purity, Innocence, and Simplicity; in which chiefly conſiſts the ſpirit of this Myſterie, and which it produceth in a ſoul that is united unto it. Thus he expreſſed uimſelf concerning them:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have beheld my ſoul upon the Bulwark of Innocence, and upon the Foundation of Death, Annihilat on, and Nakedneſs, to live in Divine Purity, with the holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe this is ſomewhat obſcure, he writ thus more clearly, to his Director:</p>

                        </gap>ewed my ſoul upon its Scituation of Death, Annihilation and Nakedneſs; that is to ſay purged and ſtripped out of its ſelf, and of every creature: For when the ſoul is ſuſpended, as in a deſart, from beholding any thing at all, and without any prop to reſt upon God draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſtraightway to himſelf, by the cords of pure love which he letteth down from heaven (as ſaith S.</hi> Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine <hi>of</hi> Genoa) <hi>and this cord is no other, than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Jeſus; in union of whom we ought to render unto God, all the rights of a perfect Sacrifice, which in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Innocence, and Simplicity, is ſacrificed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115611:129"/>for his glory. It hath often been declared to me, and this is my very baſis (as far as my infidelity may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to ſay it) that I ought to act no further, ſave by the conduct of the Infant Jeſus, having ſtill before me his ſacred actings, his unſpotted love to his Father, his ſacrificing himſelf for his Glory, and the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin; his ſubmiſſion to all his Decrees, which he underſtood diſtinctly, waited upon with patience, and executed in their ſeveral ſeaſons: In the Manger, in his flight into</hi> Egypt, <hi>in his thirty years Concealment, in his travels till his death; acting nothing by his own, but according to the perfect will of his Father. Whereby I am taught my duty, to work in the ſame purity of ſpirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> For the conſervation of which, Innocence and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city are communicated unto me, like two Bulwarks to uphold me therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Innocence is one Bulwark of this Purity; or if you pleaſe, a bright Chryſtal, through which I behold all things without offence; that is to ſay, without receiving infection from them, ſo that the vices and diſorders of men do not fix or make any impreſſion upon me. This Innocence carries me forth to my neighbour with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great benignity and ſweetneſs, and is an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible relief and ſuccour to me in all imployments, by reaſon of the multitude of miſchiefs and ſins I daily meet with; it being my Saviours pleaſure I ſhould fly to this for remedy againſt them. Innocence therefore applies it ſelf to what is before me in all my actions, to the end that Purity ſhould receive no trouble in its operation; that is to ſay, in the reſpect it hath towards God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simplicity is the other Bulwark and Guard of Purity, and hath its influence chiefly upon what is paſt and done, ſeparating my ſoul from all duplicity, and multiplicity,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115611:130"/>and reflections upon what hath been done or ſeen. Thus is my ſoul happily incloſed betwixt two Bulwarks, and two Walls; whereof the one,</hi> viz. <hi>Innocence, preſerveth her againſt the preſent and the future; the other, of Simplicity, from what is paſt and behinde her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Happy are thoſe ſouls, that are called to this Myſterie, and to be acquainted with, and enjoy God, made man, in the Manger: From which, no doubt, they receive great bleſſings, in the penetration and poſſeſſion of the Purity, Innocence and Simplicity of this Divine Babe; in the ſame manner as men finde it more eaſie, to obtain favours on the Birth-day, or Coronation of a great Prince, than at other times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus this man of God, and Infant of Grace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his ſenſe touching theſe three Vertues, and ſuch the noble and divine uſes which he made of them: Purity having influence on his intentions, ruling in all his Interiour and Exteriour actions, ſo that thereby he ſingly aimed at the glory and intereſt of God: Juſt as an infant worketh ſimply, according to nature, in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, crying, hearing, eating and ſleeping; perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe purely, according to natures principles, both for the efficient and final cauſe of each of them. In like manner, doth the childe of Grace, produce all his actions by the inſtinct of Grace, and hath it for his ultimate end, purely aiming at Gods glory, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt Jeſus, who behaved himſelf in the ſame manner in the Manger, towards God his Father; even as a ſucking childe by innocence he looketh upon every object, with a pure and innocent eye, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged upon any thing, but abſtracted and free from all malice, all impreſſions of their Species or Idea's, much
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115611:130"/>more from all pollution from them; like as the Sun ſhineth upon a dunghil, without taint or imperfection.</p>
                  <p>Simplicity quitted him from all multiplicity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, reflections upon his own Intereſt, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies, Vanity, paſſion of Joy or Sadneſs, from any of his own Performances or Speeches, from Praiſe or Diſpraiſe, or from the Vices of the Times, Places, or Perſons he converſed with, to receive any pollution from them; no otherwiſe than a new-born childe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth a Pageantry which paſſeth before it, which is forgotten as ſoon as removed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Purity directed his eye in a ſtraight line to God, pretending to nothing but his glory, in any thing that man had a hand in.</p>
                  <p>And this proceeding of his, all ought to imitate, if they deſire to make progreſs in Vertue, and arrive to perfection; and particularly, thoſe that treat much with their neighbour in the negotiation of his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they may do it with more advantage to him, and with no damage to themſelves.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough what we have hitherto ſaid of the Heroick Vertues, and famous Actions of Monſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> which had reſpect either to his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or the good of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is very remarkable: Yet the principal and more admirable, is that which remains: <hi>viz.</hi> The ſtate of his Interiour, and his communication with God.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that the Kings-daughter is all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious within; and the Holy Ghoſt ſetteth forth in lofty expreſſions, the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> for the beauty of her face, and of her whole body; But it addes,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115611:131"/>that nothing could ſufficiently be uttered concerning the hidden graces of her Soul, and Interiour, which were far more charming and attractive; even as the chief excellencies of our B. Saviour, conſiſted not in his Exteriour, or in thoſe things he did either for himſelf, or for men; but in the intimate union he had with God, and thoſe actions he produced in the profundity of his Spirit towards him: In like manner, our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection conſiſts not, in our good works, which appear outwardly, nor in the exerciſes of Charity, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Poverty, and the like Vertues open to the eye, but in the application of our ſpirit to God, and our union with him by the acts of vertue, and chiefly of the three Theological ones. It conſiſteth, I ſay, in honouring and adoring him in the Temple of our ſouls; in performing to him there, the Sacrifices of a lively Faith, upon the Altar of our Underſtanding; in offering up the Holocauſts of perfect Hope, and ardent Charity, upon the Altar of our Will; and in a total ſubjection of our ſpirits to his, and an union of all our faculties with him; whereby we become purified, ſanctified, and deified, proportionably, as the bleſſed Saints are in heaven, where this perfection is compleated.</p>
                  <p>This was Monſieur <hi>Renties</hi> practice, whereby he had a true feeling of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Your life is hid with God, through Jeſus Christ;</hi> concerning which, he expreſſed his thoughts thus to a friend:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is nothing in this world, ſo ſeparate from the world, as God; and the greater the Saints are, the greater is their retirement into him: This our Saviour taught us, whilſt he lived on earth, being in all his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115611:132"/>employments united to God, and retired into the boſom of his Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His principal care was, inceſſantly to cultivate and adorn his ſoul, to unite it intimately to God by the operations of his underſtanding and will; to give up himſelf, with all his ſtrength, to this hidden and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life of Faith, Hope and Charity, of Religion, of a myſtical Death, and entire Abnegation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Some years before his death, his particular attractive was, the contemplation of the B. Trinity, being the laſt end in which all muſt terminate: Whereof he gave this account to his Spiritual Guide, in the year, 1645.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I carry about with me ordinarily, an experimental verity, and a plenitude of the preſence of the Holy Trinity.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>How that the proper and ſpecial effect of Chriſtian grace is, to make us know God in the Trinity, uniting us to the Son, who cauſeth us to work by his Spirit. And to ſay the truth, we are conſecrated by our Baptiſm to the worſhip of the B. Trinity: Therein we are conſecrated to his Glory, receive its Seal, and put on its Badge and Livery; to manifeſt to us, and to all the world, that we are perfectly and abſolutely its own.</hi>

                  <p>Being guided this way, and treading theſe pathes, he made an admirable progreſs to the higheſt pitch of perfection attainable in this life, each Perſon in the ſacred Trinity working in his ſoul, wonderful impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of grace, ſealing him with their particular cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and ſanctifying him in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                  <p>The Son transformed him into a lively image of God, through the reſemblance of his own perfections: beſtowing on him a filial ſpirit, to acquit himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in all his endeavors, with that ſingular reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſaith, confidence, love &amp; obedience, as is required from a Son to a Father; bringing him into ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as that God ſpake to him Interiourly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing in him his word, accompanied with ſuch power and ſtrength, as was able to touch mens ſouls, and work in them the bleſſed fruits of ſalvation.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Being fortified by this Faith, he was wont to ſay, that he felt no difficulty at all, when our Saviour ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly deſerted him for a time, and ſent him great aridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; attributing all thoſe inquietudes, impatience, and anxities, which we labour under, in this eſtate of privation, to the want of this grace. I have taken out of one of his Letters, what he writ to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We ſeldom meet with perſons addicted to prayer, that can behave themſelves prudently under Interior dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictions; or that can have patience to wait for ſome time at the door of ſenſible conſolations and enlightnings, without making a forcible entry; that do not chafe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and caſt this way and that way, and ſeek by their
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115611:135"/>own means to procure them; ſeeking for another ſupport than that of Faith, which alone ſhould ſuffice any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man: Theſe ſenſible guſts are but ſent as ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the littleneſs, and cordials for the faintings of faith: But the juſt ſhould live by faith, and upon that foundation reſt himſelf in expectation of our Saviour with patience: Our inconveniences ariſe from hence, that we are a people of little faith, to diſcern things by its light, although we often pretend to know more than really we do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To another he writ concerning this point (upon the ſubject of the Centurions faith) thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where ſhall we meet with a Faith comparable to that of the Centurion? Alas, what a ſhame is this to our Spiritual perſons, who talk much of Faith, but indeed have little more than the ſound, ſcarce any thing of the truth and effect thereof? how few are there that can bear the afflictions of ſpirit or body, with a naked Faith, and ſuch a ſimplicity, as ſooketh remedy onely from God, and maketh uſe of patience, when comfort doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo ſoon as expected: We all covet to enjoy Jeſus Chriſt ſenſibly, and that he would come to our houſes, to cure our anxieties: And for want of theſe ſenſible comforts, the Spirit runs and wanders on all hands, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repoſe, but findes it not, becauſe indeed it is not to be found in her action, but onely in her ſacrifice made in Faith, which brings down the Spirit of Chriſt, which is our ſtrength and life, in the midſt of troubles, and of death. The Centurien was aſhamed and confounded that Chriſt would come to his houſe, his Faith mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far above theſe ſenſible ſigns: Whereupon he is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115611:135"/>with the name of a true believer, and ſo propounded to us for a pattern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> being animated by this ſpirit of Faith, made no reliance upon any thing that came to him by an extraordinary way; reſting neither upon Viſions, Revelations, inward Motions or Miracles, but ſoully upon a pure and naked Faith, to carry him to God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe following lines he writ to his Director, touching a buſineſs of great importance:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſend you a Paper, which I received three moneths ſince, from a perſon of great vertue, whom you know; which ſhe had kept for me, not daring to truſt it ith any others: That which confirmeth me in the opinion I had of her ſolid vertue is, that ſhe never told me any thing, to which I did not finde my ſelf prediſpoſed Interiourly: This is as a ſeal to confirm my former reſolutions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, without building any certainty upon the thing it ſelf: for we ſhould be emptied of all reliance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing, and of all reflections, following in ſimplicity of Faith, without diſpute, that which our Saviour doth to the ſoul for the time preſent, be it concerning this or that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Going to <hi>Beaulne,</hi> where Siſter <hi>Margaret</hi> of the B. Sacrament reſided (famous for many miracles, which God had wrought in her, and a perſon very worthy to be viſited) he ſaid, That he would neither deſire to ſee her, nor ſpeak with her; onely if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhould make known unto him, that ſuch was his
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115611:136"/>will, he would endeavour it, otherwiſe he would not ſeek any occaſion for it.</p>
                  <p>Another time being at <hi>Dijon,</hi> when the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was expoſed, ſome friends inviting him to draw near to the Altar; he replyed, That he had no need of ſight for to believe, and that his Faith went further than what his eyes could ſhew him.</p>
                  <p>Hereby we may underſtand the great Faith of this man of God; and undoubtedly, it was with her eyes that he beheld every thing; and by her hands, that he accompliſhed all his actions, and aſcended to ſuch a perfection of all Vertues; from whoſe example we may learn the directeſt way to attain thereto; which is, ſtedfaſtly to believe the verities of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and be perfectly perſwaded thereof: As on the contrary, the very ſource of all our ſins and vices, and generally of all the miſchiefs in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, is the weakneſs of Faith, whereby we are neither thorowly convinced of thoſe ſacred Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, nor guided in our affairs by the Rule of Faith: It was our Saviours advice, <hi>Noli timere, tantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo crede; Fear not, onely believe:</hi> If thou believeſt firmly, thou ſhalt be delivered from all evils, and be accompliſhed in all vertue.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. 3. <hi>His Hope.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>A Strong Faith, by a moral neceſſity, produceth a firm Hope and Charity: A true belief in God, what he is in himſelf, and what he is to us, will work in us a ſtrong affiance in him, and ardent charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. As appeared in Monſieur <hi>Renty,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well grounded upon a firm Faith in God, had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an undaunted confidence in him, and an inflamed affection to him.</p>
                  <p>This confidence was built upon the knowledge and experience of the Power, Goodneſs, Mercy, and Bounty of God, and of the infinite Merits of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: And being grounded upon theſe two Pillars, he hoped all things, and believed that he could accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh every thing. He uſed to ſay, that when he look'd at himſelf, there was nothing ſo little, wherein he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended not difficulty; but when he look'd upon God, he could think nothing impoſſible to himſelf: And this diſtruſt of himſelf was not a diſheartned and Lazy Humility, but couragious and magnanimous, as is requiſite in thoſe, who undertake things neceſſary, though not conſcious of any ability of their own for the performance.</p>
                  <p>He writ to a perſon concerning theſe two grand points, which indeed ought to hold the ballance of all our actions even before God.</p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:115611:137"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The diffidence you have in your ſelf, makes me very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the good of ſuch a condition, and upon the ſure foundation thereof, which the Church deſires we ſhould ever conſerve, placing at the beginning of every hour of the Divine Office, this Virſicle,</hi> Deus in Adjutorium meum intende, Domine ad adjuvandum me feſtina; O Lord attend unto my help, O Lord make haſte to aſſiſt me: <hi>Whereby we learn, that the ſoul is in continual danger of a Precipice, if not ſuſtained by that infinite mercy, which he is daily to invoke, for her preſervation from ruine: And really, we ſhould continually fall, if we were not continually ſupported; therefore the Church hath divided her Office for the ſeaven parts of the day, in that the number of ſeven comprehends all time: the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created under this number, to teach us, that we ſhould at all times retain this Diffidence of our ſelves, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Gods aſsiſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Hope of his, was ſo great, that in all affairs he relyed not upon his own prudence, conduct, care, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, providence, or any humane contrivancies, but on God alone; ſaying, That after we have done our duty, with great Diffidence in our ſelves, we ought to attend wholly on him, and wait his time, without preſſing the buſineſs; or entrenching upon his Prerogative. And thus he writ to a friend:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for my children, I leave them in the hands of the Holy Infant Jeſus, without determining any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, not knowing what will befal to morrow: He giveth me great confidence in his protection, which renders me altogether blinde, without wiſhing any thing, but being ready for his will in every thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:115611:137"/>
                  <p>Guarded with this perfect confidence, he feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but remained firm and reſolute againſt all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and encounters: He walked ſecurely in all places, at all times, in the ſtreets, in the fields, by day and night, travelling thorow Woods and Forreſts that were bruted to be dangerous, and frequented by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, without fear, without other defenſive weapons than what his confidence in God did arm him with, carrying about him ſo much goodneſs, he was above all thoſe frights, which nature is ſubject to, not moved with ſudden alarms or accidents; ſo that we may call him, The Chriſtian without fear: And to ſay the truth, there is nothing deſerves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>One day a ſcaffold, on which he ſtood with the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, erected about his building, fell down, and hurt ſome of them; with which he was not amazed, or moved at all, for his own particular. His ſpirit remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unmoveable, and in the ſame conſtancy, being firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled upon him that is not ſubject to a change or alteration.</p>
                  <p>A friend told him one day, that he was fearful to walk in the evening without a ſword, in the ſtreets of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that he deſired to be quit of that timerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet could not ſatisfie himſelf, to be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed in caſe of an aſſault, intreating his advice in the buſineſs: Who told him, that of a long time he had left off the uſe of a ſword; and that after he had commended the buſineſs to God by prayer, he ſhould follow his inſpiration; aſſuring himſelf, that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection over us, is much according to our relying upon him.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:115611:138"/>
                  <p>Theſe words were found in one of his Letters to his Director:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My ſoul being armed with Confidence, Faith, and Love, fears neither the Devil, nor Hell nor all the ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of man; neither think I at all, on Heaven, or Earth, but onely how to fulfil the will of God in every thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath been noted to do very notable things through the ſtrength of this Vertue, even at ſuch times, when he hath been afflicted with great aridities in his Interiour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In our aridities and privation, of the ſenſe and feeling of grace</hi> (ſaith he, in a Letter to a friend) <hi>is manifeſted an heroick abnegation of our ſelves to the will of God; when under Hope, believing againſt Hope we ſhew our ſelves to be true ſons of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>ſhall not dye, though the knife be at his throat; and in caſe the true</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhould, in fine, be crucified, it is but to make us conformable to the Croſs, and cut of our aſhes to raiſe us to a true and better life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus likewiſe he writ to his Director:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe words,</hi> Longanimiter ferens, bearing patiently,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115611:138"/>
                     <hi>have dwelt longe upon my ſpirit, though I did not at firſt remember whence they were taken, or what they meant: onely this, that I muſt wait with patience for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and approach of my Saviour, without putting my ſelf forward by my own inqueſt or endeavours, but reſt with faith and reverence, begging his grace, and hope in him: But a few days ago, taking up the New Teſtament, in opening the Book, I did light upon the ſixth Chapter to the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby we obtain the promiſes;</hi> qui fide &amp; pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia haereditabit promiſſiones; who by faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſhall inheret the promiſes; <hi>and to prove this, brings in the example of</hi> Abraham, &amp; ſic longanimiter ferens adeptus eſt repromiſſionem; and ſo waiting pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently obtained the promiſe: <hi>This paſſage touched me to the very heart, and relieved my languiſhing; together with another paſſage of S.</hi> James, <hi>which preſented it ſelf to my eye at the ſame time,</hi> Patientes igitur eſtore fratres, uſque ad adventum Domini, ecce agricola expectat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioſum fructum terrae, patienter ferens; Be patient therefore, my brethren, till the coming of our Lord, behold the husbandman waiteth patiently, till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fruit of the earth: <hi>Hereby I was ſettled in peace, upon the ſolid foundation of Hope and Abnegation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As this incomparable Vertue enricheth the ſoul that is perfectly ſtated in it, with a profound repoſe, a ſolid joy, a wonderful courage, and ſets it aloft above all Terreſtrial things, with a generous contempt of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the world eſteems and deſires, giving it a taſte of the pleaſures that are Eternal (as it is not difficult for him that hath aſſured hopes of a glorious Kingdom, to ſet at nought a Pad of ſtraw;) ſo did it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115611:139"/>to this holy man, all theſe excellent treaſures, and imprinted in his ſoul all theſe noble reflections.</p>
                  <p>Whereby he was incited with all his ſtrength, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others in the purſuit of this Vertue, knowing by his own experience, the ineſtimable benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, underſtanding it to be our Lenitive in all diſaſters, our ſtaff and ſtay in all weakneſſes, and our ſecure haven in all tempeſts; inſtructing them continually, how that God, to the end that he might drive us into this Port, and cauſe us to reſt in it, doth frequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to be aſſaulted with temptations and tryals, the deeplier to engage us to have recourſe to him, begging his aid and ſuccour, and relying upon him with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The like inſtruction he gave to a certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, upon occaſion of the Apoſtles amazement, when they beheld our Saviour walking upon the waters, and took him for a Choſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Think you this was without a ſpecial providence, that our Saviour ſuffered his Diſciples to go alone into that ſhip, and permitted a contrary winde to ariſe? Who knows not, that in the ſame manner he faſhions the ſouls of the faithful, by his abſences, and by their tryals, that he may afterwards manifeſt his power, upon the ſeas and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, quickning thereby our Faith, and ſhewing himſelf to be the Meſſias and true Deliverer of the world: But, obſerve we, how many Chriſtians in their ſufferings, are affrighted, with the Apoſtles, ſeeing our Saviour march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the waters: Every thing makes them afraid the winds, the waves, yea, even Chriſt himſelf (that is) the anxiteies of their ſpirit, their own diſputings, and alſo thoſe good courſels that others give them for their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Chriſt Jeſus, before God: All this appears
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115611:139"/>but as a Ghoſt to amaze them, unleſs Chriſt himſelf graciouſly appear yet more unto them, to comfort and ſtrengthen them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall we always want confidence, thus to think Chriſt a Phantaſm? Shall we not addreſs our ſelves to him in all our neceſſities, as to our Lord and Deliverer? The Jews brought all their ſick folks to him, and he cured them: What, is he become a greater Phyſician of the body, than of the ſoul? No, no, our little Faith, our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Love, our little Confidence, is the cauſe of our languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and unfruitful anxieties of ſpirit: Let us go ſtrait to him, and all will be cured.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>SEeing the Love of God is without contradiction the moſt excellent and perfect of all vertues, and that which principally, and above all the reſt makes a man a Saint; we cannot doubt, that this holy man was poſſeſſed thereof in a very eminent degree, and that he loved God with all his heart. This Love he founded upon his infinite perfections and favours; which may be perceived by what he writ to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector in the year, 1648. concerning this Queen of all Vertues.</p>
                  <p>

They all concenter in this one point, the love of God through Jeſus Chriſt, his communication of himſelf to us by the Incarnation of his Eternal Word, and ours to him through the ſame Word, becoming our brother, converſing with us, and erecting, as it were, a mutual ſociety, that we may be all one in him, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally feel what the love of God is toward us.</hi>

                     <hi>In all that I read in the Scripture, I neither underſtand nor find any thing elſe but this Love; and perceive clearly, that the very deſign and end of Chriſtianity is nothing but it,</hi> Finis autem praecepti eſt charitas de corde puro; The end of the Law is love, out of a ſincere heart: <hi>And this is acquired by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the following words,</hi> Fide non ficta; by faith unfeigned: <hi>Which uniteth and bindeth us to him; whereby we ſacrifice unto the Divinity, our ſouls and our bodies, through his Spirit, which conducteth us to the compleat end of the Law, to deliver us up to God, and bring down him to us, in charity, and a gracious inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable union, to whom be praiſe for ever, Amen.</hi>

                     <hi>The third is, to ſerve him (that is) by putting this love into practice by good works: For theſe deſires are but bloſſoms, and theſe good works the fruit: I could ſay much on this ſubject, if I could expreſs my own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: For here we finde all in all; that is, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by Jeſus Chriſt, loved and ſerved by his Spirit.

                  <p>Thus did he expreſs the nature of Love, not to conſiſt in taking, but giving; and the more and greater matters we give, the more we manifeſt our Love: This Love carries up the Lover, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of its flame, continually to think upon his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, to will what may pleaſe him, to ſtudy his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115611:141"/>to procure his glory, to do every thing that may work his contentment, and to be extreamly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of any thing that may offend him.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, he being all on fire with the love of God, was perfectly ſinſible of theſe effects: All his thoughts, words, and works were the productions of this love; for notwithſtanding he practiſed other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, yet they drew their original from this Furnace of Charity, which in him was the beginning, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and end of all: which he teſtified to his Confidents frequently, and in words ſo enkindled with it, as were ſufficient to warm the moſt frozen hearts. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (ſaith one of his Confidents) this Divine fire ſo ardent in his bleſſed ſoul, that the flames thereof have burſt forth into his Exteriour; and he hath told me, that when ever he proncunced the name of God, he taſted ſuch a ſweetneſs upon his lips, as could not be expreſſed; and that he was even pierced thorow with a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avenly ſuavity. To another he write about 9. or 10. years agoe that he could nor conceal from him, how he felt a fire in his heart, which burnt and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without ceaſing.</p>
                  <p>Another of them aſſures, that he hath often ſeen him enflamed with this Love of God, that he appeared even like one beſides himſelf; and how he told him, when theſe tranſportings were upon him, that he was ready to caſt himſelf into thefire to teſtifie his Love to God: and in one of his Letters to a friend, he concludes thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I muſt now hold my peace, yet when I ceaſe to ſpeak, the fire within, that conſumes me, will not let me reſt: Let us burn then, and burn wholly, and in every part, for God: ſince we have no being but by him, why then do we not live to him? I ſpeak it aloud, and it would be
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115611:141"/>my crown of glory, to ſeal it with my blood, and this I utter to you with great freedom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a Letter to another thus: <hi>I know not what your intent was, to put into your Letter theſe words,</hi> Deus meus, &amp; omnia; my God, and my all: <hi>Onely you invite thereby, to return the ſame to you, and to all creatures.</hi> My God, and my all; my God, and my all; my God, and my all. <hi>If perhaps you take this for your motto, and uſe it to expreſs how full your heart is of it; think you it poſſible I ſhould be ſilent upon ſuch an invitation, and not expreſs my ſenſe thereof! Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, be it known to you therefore, that he is</hi> my God, and my all: <hi>And if you doubt of it, I ſhall ſpeak it a hundred times over. I ſhall adde no more, for any thing elſe is ſuperfluous to him that is truly penetrated with</hi> my God, and my all: <hi>I leave you therefore in this happy ſtate of Jubilation, and conjure you to beg for me of God, the ſolid ſenſe of theſe words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being tranſported with this Love of God, it wrought in him an incredible zeal of his honour, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and advanced a thouſand ways: Which may be underſtood partly by what we have already writ, and ſeveral other which are unknown, becauſe either they were wholly ſpiritual, or concealed by him even from his moſt intimate friends, The 12 of <hi>March,</hi> in the year, 1645. he writ thus to his Director, upon this ſubject:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>One day being tranſported with an earneſt deſire to be all to God, and all conſumed for him, I offered up to him all I could, yea, and all that I could not: I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115611:142"/>have made a Deed of Gift to him of Heaven and Earth, if they had been mine. And in another way, I would willingly have been the underling of all mankinde, and in the baſeſt eſtate poſſible; yea, and if ſupported by his grace, I could have been content, to have ſuffered eternal pains with the damned, if any glory might have accrew'd to him thereby. In this diſpoſition of a calm zeal, there is no ſort of Martyrdome, no degree of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or littleneſs, of honour or diſgrace, that paſſed not through my ſpirit, and which my ſoul would not readily have embraced for the advancement of his glory: Here a man would be content to be a King, to govern all; or the meaneſt Beggar, or moſt miſerable Wretch, to ſuffer all for him; and this without reaſon, through an exceſs of reaſon. It is an impoſſible thing to underſtand, how in ſo ſhort time the ſoul ſhould wiſh ſuch different things, and a large diſcourſe would be too narrow to declare one circumstance thereto belonging: All I could do in this condition, was to give up my liberty to God, writing the Deed in paper, and ſigning it with my own blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See here the zeal of a man, all on fire with the love of God, where likewiſe his conformity to his will, an infallible mark of this love, is very obſerveable. Thoſe perſons who knew him perfectly, report, that this intimate union of his will to Gods will, was one of his ſingular graces; and himſelf declared, that he was conſtantly in this bleſſed frame, to which he had applied himſelf more particularly for ſeveral years, in which he made it evidently appear, that the object and end of all his actions, was the Divine will, into which his own was wholly abſorpt.</p>
                  <p>He writ thus to one concerning the ſickneſs and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115611:142"/>death of the Counteſs of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> to whom he had (as we have formerly mentioned) a very near relation, founded upon grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I muſt tell you, that during my abſence from the Counteſs of</hi> Caſtres, <hi>my heart was tenderly ſenſible of her pain, knowing that ſhe ſuffered very much: But my deſire ſubmits to the Order of God, and when that is ſignified to me, he gives me grace to obey. Coming to</hi> Paris, <hi>I received the news of her death; when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned my ſelf wholly to God, attending his good pleaſure for what would follow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another time he writ thus to his Director:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have been held theſe three weeks with a ſeavour, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a defluxion, and an exceeding great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and my frame of ſpirit during this condition, hath been a ſimple proſecution of, and adherence to the will and pleaſure of God: I diſcover nothing in particular worth writing to you, ſaving that I have a heart ready to receive any afflictions that can befall me. I deſire whatever is decreed from above, and beg it with all my heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſet down before, how that in the year, 1641. one of his children whom he dearly loved, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life. When the news was brought him, he ſpake not one word, nor ſhewed the leaſt diſturbance, but abſolutely ſubmitted to the order of God, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding thereunto in a perfect reconciliation of his own affection to the childe, and his great loſs of him.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the year, 1643. his Lady fell deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115611:143"/>ſick, even to death, being left of all her Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, ſpeechleſs, and without ſenſe; but he, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the deep reſentment of ſuch a heavy loſs, and a buſineſs that touched him to the quick, manifeſted ſuch an abſolute conformity to the will of God, as brake forth into theſe words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I cannot deny, but my nature is deeply affected with the ſenſe of ſo great a loſs, yet my ſpirit is filled with ſo wonderful a joy, to ſee my ſelf in ſuch a ſtate, as to give up and ſacrifice to my God, a thing ſo near and dear to me, that if civility did not forbid it, I would make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear outwardly, and give ſome publique teſtimony of my readineſs thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this heroick deportment, he evidenced that the will of God was ſo abſolutely his, that he not onely will'd that which he will'd, though never ſo difficult, but that he willed it as God doth, that is, with much pleaſure and content: for ſo God doth not ſimply will and act things, but wills and acts them with infinite it delight, being in himſelf moſt infinitely happy. But pleaſed God to reſtore his Lady to her health, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect (as we may piouſly imagine) to this heroical car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his faithful ſervant; as likewiſe to avow he made to our bleſſed Lady, for the obtaining thereof.</p>
                  <p>Neither did his conformity onely go thus far, but advanced further yet, even to things of a higher conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, referring to his perfection and ſalvation; for notwithſtanding that he earneſtly aſpired to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and endeavoured thereafter with an unſpeakable courage, fervour, and diligence, yet all this was with an entire reſignation of himſelf to the deſigns of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:115611:143"/>
                  <p>For opening his caſe to this Director upon this point, he writ thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My preſent condition conſiſts in an adherence of my will to whatſoever God is pleaſad concerning me, and this I am ſenſible of from the bottom of my ſoul: I have of late undergone very great aridities of ſpirit (except ſome few intervals) where all is ſaid open, and my ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth herſelf to God in an inexplicable manner, from which ſhe remains full of certainty and of truths, which will not eaſily vaniſh, though they cannot without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be unfolded,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having writ and ſigned with his own blood a Deed of Gift of his Liberty, as we have mentioned before, he writ thus to the ſame perſon concerning it:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From that inſtant, God hath beſtowed upon me ſuch a conformity to his will, that as I acknowledge all things to be guided by his hand, ſo likewiſe I receive every thing from it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to another intimate friend he writ thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The party</hi> (meaning himſelf) <hi>hath, ſince that time, felt ſuch a wonderful great conformity to the will of God, that he can will nothing, but what God willeth; neither can he underſtand how any man ſhould will any thing elſe: this makes every thing paſs ſmoothly and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This diſpoſition of ſpirit made him look upon things, not in themſelves, but as contain'd in the will of God; and this he gave as a chief advice to attain to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:115611:144"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It behoveth a ſoul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to give up it ſelf to God; walking on in ſimplicity in all its operations; applying it ſelf to every thing, not for the thing it ſelf, but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the will of God, not engaged at all to it, but to God, obeying and honouring him in every thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And from this perfect ſubordination to the will of God, ſprung his admirable Tranquillity of minde; and from this fountain, flowed thoſe rivers of peace and profound repoſe, which he poſſeſſed in ſo great perfection; that from the moſt ſudden ſurprizals, his ſpirit was not altered one jot, neither were his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour faculties of body put into any diſorder, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acknowledgeth.</p>
                  <p>For thus he writ to me one day:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I comprehend not that thing you call Mortification: If one lives in this eſtate of Conformity; for ſuch finding no reſiſtance in his ſpirit, is not capable of it: Who ſo willeth whatever God willeth, is daily content, let what will happen.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>ONe of the moſt excellent diſpoſitions of the ſoul, in her Interiour life, is that of great Reverence in the preſence of God; as the Scriptures mention, that the Angels continually abaſe and caſt down them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Reverence before his Sacred Majeſtie: And Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> was deeply affected with this noble part of Devotion, ſpeaking to God with ſo great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, as it proceeded into trembling.</p>
                  <p>And this unſpeakable reſpect unto Gods Greatneſs, cauſed him often to walk in the fields bareheaded, in the heat of the Sun or any other unſeaſonable weather: And being asked by a near friend, what it was that kept him in ſuch a conſtant awfulneſs, and how he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to that wonderful Reverence he bore to God, in all places, in all employments, and at all times. He anſwered, The ſight of his glorious Majeſtie, which continually ſeems preſent by me, produceth in me this effect, keeping me in exceeding great awe, with a deep ſenſe of his greatneſs, and my own vileneſs, and nothingneſs, in compariſon of him. A mote in the Sun you will ſay is little, but I am far leſs than that before God, being indeed nothing.</p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:115611:145"/>
                  <p>Writing to his Director, <hi>June</hi> 1. 1647. he ſaith:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have been buſied all this last moneth in ſtudying my own baſeneſs, I am ſeized with great confuſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with exceeding Reverence before God, as one that hath his eyes caſt down before the Throne of his Majeſtie, not daring to look up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to another perſon he writ thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us behave our ſelves in the preſence of God, as the men of the world do before their Prince; who not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they be men of ſpirit, and have their heads full of weighty buſineſs, yet ſtand bare in his preſence, and with modeſt and humble behaviour, forbear to ſpeak, not liſtening to any thing but what he ſpeaks, forgetting all other buſineſs: And all this they are obliged to by civil reſpect, and pay this duty to one, perhaps, inferiour to themſelves in natural parts. How much more ſhould the Holineſs, the Majeſtie, the Infinite Greatneſs of God, raviſh us from our ſelves, and work in us a moſt profound Reverence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold here what wonderful deep ſenſe of his own vileneſs, this holy man bore in the preſence of God; which indeed well becometh, not onely ſinners, but the holieſt men upon earth. He that beholds the Sun from a valley, when it riſeth and appears upon the point of a high mountain, thinks him that ſtands above, to be near it, and that he is able almoſt to reach it with his hand, when the ſame man notwithſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds it at a vaſt diſtance above his head; and though in reallity he is nearer it than the other in the valley, yet within ſuch a ſmall proportion, as ſcarce deſerves
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115611:145"/>to be named, in reſpect of the total diſtance.</p>
                  <p>In like manner God, in his Greatneſs, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and all his Infinite Perfections, is ſo far above, not onely us that are moſt imperfect, but even all thoſe that are arrived to the top of the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that all of us muſt debaſe and caſt down our ſelves, with a moſt profound annihilation in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  <p>This great reſpect he bore to the preſence of God, together with his ardent love toward him (of which we have ſpoken in the former Chapter) imprinted in him a horrible averſion to the Teaſt thing that might offend him; as likewiſe, a wonderful purity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. His Confeſſors report, that he excelled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in even to aſtoniſhment; and that the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had very little in him. He told a familiar friend one day, that it much afflicted him when he was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to any others beſides his ordinary Confeſſor, becauſe they not underſtanding his condition, could not ſo well apprehend him; and that he was often troubled to finde ſomething to confeſs to them.</p>
                  <p>And this purity will be beſt known to us, by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; <hi>viz.</hi> his ſins, which he was accuſtomed to ſend monethly to his Director, a Letter, who lived a great diſtance from him; and theſe were ſent by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meſſengers, ſigned with his one hand, which were ſubject to be intercepted; an evidence of an heroick humility, in a perſon of his quality.</p>

                  <p>And truly, theſe may demonſtrate, to what height of Purity and Innocency, a ſoul that is watchful over herſelf, may arrive: Seeing a Gentleman of his birth and age, in a Secular life, and the throng of ſo great employments, attained hereto; onely if we uſe the like diligence, and be faithful to the Spirit of God, the onely means to attain to this perfection.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>MOnſieur <hi>Renty</hi> did not onely carry a great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to, God, but likewiſe to all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Service, and to all Holy things; which ſprang from that ſenſe of Vertue and Religion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in his ſoul, producing the like fruits Exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, he had a ſingular reſpect to all Holy places; and it will be very hard to reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ved himſelf in Churches. At his entrance, his demeanour was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding modeſt, and religiouſly grave: He never ſare down there, nor put on his hat, not ſo mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h as in Sermon time; he would abide there as long as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he could, and hath been obſerved, upon great Feſtivals, to remain there upon his knees for ſeven or eight hours: He was very ſilent in the Church, and if any perſon of any condition ſpoke to him, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was ſhort; and in caſe the buſineſs required longer time, he would carry him forth, or ſome other way free himſelf thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he uſed great veneration to all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical perſons, even to the meaneſt; but the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he gave to Prieſts was wonderful. He would never take the upper hand of them, without extream violence, as appears by that paſſage in the former Chapter. Whenſoever he met them, he ſaluted them
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115611:147"/>with profound humility, and in his travel, would light off his horſe to do it, and render them all honour poſſible. When they came to viſit him, he entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them cordially, with exceeding great reſpect, at their departure, waiting on them to the gate; and if any dined at his table, gave them the upper place, which civility he obſerved to his own Chaplain.</p>
                  <p>When any Miſſion was in any of his Lordſhips, he entertained the Miſſioners apart, where they were ſerved in plate, when other Gentlemen and perſons of quality that viſited him, were onely in pewter, waving herein all humane reſpects. A Nobleman and his Lady came one day to him upon a viſit, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a Prieſt, that was Tutor to their children. After he had received them, obſerving the Prieſt at the lower end of his Hall, with ſome of their Retinue; quitting civilly the Nobleman and his Lady, he went down to the Prieſt, ſhewing great reſpect to him, as to the moſt honoatable perſon of the company.</p>
                  <p>In fine, his opinion of the Prieſthood was ſo vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, looking upon it as the moſt potent means for procuring the glory of God; that he ſaid to a friend, That he had a deſign to enter into that Order, if God ſhould ever bring him into a condition capable of it.</p>
                  <p>And as he had this ſingular Reverence toward them, ſo likewiſe had he an earneſt deſire that they, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all Eccleſiaſtical perſons, ſhould underſtand the excellency of the condition, to whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h God had call'd them, leading a life agreeable to their Dignity. He writ to his Director in the year, 1645. upon occaſion of ſeveral Eccleſiaſticks of his acquaintance, who correſpond not to their Profeſſion and Obligation; that his heart melted into ſorrow for them, and that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115611:148"/>he proſtrated himſelf before his Saviour, and begged with tears for ſome Apoſtolike Spirits to be ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us our poor Fiſhermen;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Give us, O Lord, our poor Fiſhermen, I often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I meant the Apoſtles. But this word ran much in my minde, not being able to uſe any other; and my ſpirit wronght much upon theſe words,</hi> Peſcheurs &amp; Pecheurs, <hi>Fiſhermen and Sinners. I look upon theſe men, ſimple indeed in their Exteriour, but great Princes in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour, whoſe life and outward appearance vile, in the eyes of men, and eſtranged from the pomp of the world; converted ſouls, by their Sanctity, by their Prayers, by their V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>With the ſame ſpirit he bewailed much, the haſty and irreverent reciting of their Office in many places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Being this day preſent at Divine Service</hi> (ſaith he in a Letter to me) <hi>many words therein put me in minde of the holineſs thereof; and yet I could not without much grief, take notice of ſome chanting it haſtily, without devotion or ſpirit, and others hearing it accordingly: Good God, what pitty is this! where is our faith? My eyes were ready to run over with tears, but I forced my ſelf to refrain them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:115611:148"/>
                  <p>In the third place, he had a great reſpect and love to Religious Perſons, and all ſuch as dedicated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Service of God, encouraging and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with all his might.</p>
                  <p>This Letter he writ to one, that was aſſaulted with great combats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I muſt needs let you know, the tender reſentment I have of thoſe tempeſts, and preſent ſtorms that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: I know no reaſon, why men ſhould alarum you thus, nor that you have done any thing againſt the Goſpel, which is the onely thing they ſhould condemn you for: I believe it will be very hard for them, to gather a juſt cauſe of reproach from your deſign. For my own part, I do not wonder at theſe croſſes, its ſufficient to know, that you belong to Jeſus Chriſt, and do deſire to follow him, reckoning contradiction to be your portion in theſe days of your fleſh. Be you onely firm in your confidence upon our Lord, ſuffering no ſtorms from without to trouble you, or obſcure that light that hath guided and preſſed you to this buſineſs. I pray God deliver you from the reaſonings of fleſh and blood, which often multiply upon us in ſuch matters; aſſuring you, that if you give not car to them, God will manifeſt himſelf unto you (that is) he will comfort and fortifie you, in faith, and in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the gifts of his Holy Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To another he writ thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bleſſed for ever be the Bleſſed Infant Jeſus, for the happy entrance of thoſe two devout ſouls into Religion, which you mention: I ſhall rejoyce exceedingly in their
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115611:149"/>perſeverance, the beſt argument of their effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. If the other party you know of, had a little more confidence and courage, to break her fetters, it would be a great ſtep for her: And ſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly, there is not need of ſo much prudence and deliberation, to give up our ſelves to him, who to the Gentiles is fooliſhneſs, and to the Jews a ſtumbling block. This world is a ſtrange cheat and amuſement, inſinuating into, and infecting every thing. God hath no need of our good parts, nor of our rare qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, who commonly confounds the wiſdom of the wiſe by little things, which he chuſeth. Bleſſed be that little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is held for weakneſs, and yet overthroweth all the Power and Prudence of fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Treating with ſome Religious Perſons, he ſeemed, as it were, rapt on a ſudden, with the conſideration of their happy condition, ſpeaking to them thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O how happy are you my Siſters!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After which, falling upon a diſcourſe of their Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſpake ſo effectually, as wrought in them, an ample acknowledgement of their obligation to God, and a courage to proceed in well doing.</p>
                  <p>This following Letter he writ to a Gentlewoman newly entred into Religion, who next under God, did owe her calling to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I thank my Saviour with all Reverence, for thoſe good diſpoſitions to your Profeſsion, ſignified in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I understand, and am ſenſible of abundant grace wrought in you, whereby I aſſure my ſelf, of a noble pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs I am to expect, from the bounty of God; who is
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115611:149"/>to that ſoul, that gives herſelf to him,</hi> Merces magna nimis; Her exceeding great reward. <hi>You have made a leap which puts you in a new world: Bleſſed and adored be God, who in the fulneſs of time, out of his wiſdom and love to a ſoul, ſends his Son unto it to redeem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t from the Law of Servitude, and tranſlates it into the Adoption of his Sons. This hath he now wrought in you, in a more ſpecial manner, and the excellenteſt way that could be. You was never united to Jeſus Chriſt, as you are now, by your holy Profeſſion: You had heretofore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give, that was never before engaged, and he ſomething to receive, that was not formerly in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: But now all is given, and all is received, and the mutual donation is accompliſhed: No more Self, no more Life, no more Inheritance, but in Jeſus Chriſt: He is all, in all things, until the time, that (according to the Apoſtle) he delevering us up all, and wholly to his Father; his Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he had a very great Devotion to all the Saints in Heaven, but more partifulatly to S. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and S. <hi>Tereſa;</hi> whom in the year, 1640. he choſe for his Patroneſs; and above all the reſt, to the Saint of Saints, the B. Virgin; in teſtimony whereof, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated himſelf to her Service at <hi>Ardilliers,</hi> then, when he deſigned himſelf for a Carthuſian. And in the year, 1640. he deſired to be admitted into the Society erected to her honour, in the houſe of the profeſſed of the Jeſuits of S. <hi>Lewis;</hi> and for many years, he wore a ſeal upon his arm; with her Image graven, wherewith he ſealed all his Letters. We have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe mentioned, how he gave to an Image of <hi>Noſtre-Dame
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115611:150"/>de Grace,</hi> a heart of Chryſtal, ſet in Gold, to teſtifie to that <hi>Admirable Mother</hi> (as he uſed often to ſtile her) his love; and that with this heart, he reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to her his own.</p>
                  <p>Finally, this man of God, moſt entirely honoured and loved the Spouſe of Chriſt, his Holy Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verencing every thing that came from her, making great account of all her ceremonies, ſaying, That he found a certam grace, and particular vertue in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and cuſtoms of the Church: conforming himſelf moſt readily to her practiſes. Being preſent common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at High-Maſs in <hi>Paris,</hi> he would go to the Offering amongſt the people, and ordinarily with ſome poor man: He aſſiſted at ceremonies, where it was rare to finde, not onely men of his quality, but far meaner perſons; as, the conſecrating of the Fonts in the Holy Week, at long Proceſſions, in all extremities of weather.</p>
                  <p>Upon which occaſion, he writ one day to a friend:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Proceſsion goeth this day into the Suburbs, and ſince our Saviour hath favoured us with this great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to be of this little flock, we ought to follow his ſtandard; and I take it for a ſignal honour, to follow the Croſs, which way, our holy Mother, the Church, leads us; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in her, but what is glorious, ſince ſhe acts in every thing, by the Spirit of Religion, in the preſence of God; whereby ſhe unfolds great myſteries, to thoſe that are humble and reſpective.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which expreſſions &amp; actions, we may infer, that he being a man of ſuch quality, and taken up with ſuch a multitude of buſineſs, had a very reverend eſteem of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115611:150"/>all the ceremonies of the Church, otherwiſe he would never have rendred ſuch Obedience and Honour to them.</p>
                  <p>And though it be moſt true, that he highly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe ceremonies, yet he deſired likewiſe, that by the Exteriour pomp that appeared to the eyes, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might be led on to the Interiour, and more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, complaining, that the outward Magnificence wherewith Churches are adorned, do often ſtay and amuſe them, and inſtead of carrying them on to God their chief end, diverts them from him. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he writ thus to a friend:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We ſhould take notice of that ſimplicity, in which the Divine Myſteries were conveyed to us, that we may not be held too long with the ſplendour, in which at this day they are celebrated: Theſe thoughts came into my minde, in hearing the Organs and Church Muſick, and beholding the rich Ornaments uſed in the Divine Office; we muſt look thorow this ſtate, at that ſpirit of Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Purity, and Humility, of their primitive Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Not but that theſe are holy and uſeful; but that we ſhould paſs thorow it to the Simplicity and Poverty of</hi> Bethlehem, Nazareth, Egypt, <hi>the Wilderneſs, and the Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But above all, he was ſingularly devoted to an union of ſpirit and affection, and univerſal commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all good things, whith all the faithful, in all places of the world; and to be admitted into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, being an Article of our Creed, very dear unto him.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore he highly valued all, of each Nation and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115611:151"/>Profeſſion, without eſpouſing any particular ſpirit, or intereſt, to reſpect one above others, to magnifie one, and derogate from another: He honoured all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks Secular, and communicated with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all his Exerciſes of Charity for his Neighbour: he gave great reſpect to all Pariſh Prieſts, was very ſerviceable to him of his own Pariſh: he frequented the Societies of the Religious, loved and made uſe of them for direction of his conſcience.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding the great variety, and ſeveral orders of them in the Church, yet was not his heart divided, but affected with an equal eſteem, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and a general affection to all, according to their degree, being guided herein by one Spirit; <hi>viz.</hi> that of Chriſt Jeſus, which enliveneth all the faithful, as members of his body; in the ſame manner, as out bodily members, notwithſtanding they be different, in ſight, figure, and offices, are knit together, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agree, becauſe they are all quickned by the ſame ſoul: All miſintelligence and diſagreeing is a ſign of two ſpirits that rule there; and diviſion is the principle of death.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this communion of Saints, he one day ſuffered ſome difficulty: Whereupon he writ this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Letter to his Directo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>I finde experimentally, a real union both in light and faith with the party I mentioned, which is more than palpable, giving me aſſurance, that we are all one. Upon this occaſion I ſhall acquaint you, in what manner my minde hath been buſied theſe few laſt days, and is yet full of it; and to the end my relation may be more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, I ſhall take the matter ſomewhat higher.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The operation I have found in my ſelf for theſe two or three years, hath conſtantly held me fixed in the purſuit of our Saviour Chriſt, to finde in him Eternal-Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God the Father, through the influence of his Spirit; of which I have from time to time given you account: And now I confeſs to you, that though for that time I alſo honoured from the bottom of my heart, our B. Lady, the Saints and Angels, and have been deſirous to expreſs it upon all occaſions; yet ſo it was, that their preſence and their commerce was obſcured in, and, as it were, very remote from my ſoul.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I aſſure you, that thoſe thoughts hath frequently run in my minde; ſaying thus within my ſelf, I ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our Lady, and ſome other Saints and Angels, and I know not where they are: I lifted up my heart eaſily towards them, but there was no preſence of them at all, at leaſt, ſuch as I now perceive it. Some moneths ago, I poſſeſſed an opening, and a light in my ſoul, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with powerful effects, concerning love and dear union with God, making me to conceive inexplicable things of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt (who is perfect Charity) not by the reaſonings and diſcourſes of the underſtanding, but by a ſingle view, moſt by one touch penetrating the heart with love: And I beheld, how the Son of God our Saviour, came to advance us by his Incarnation, into this love, uniting himſelf to us, whereby to reduce us all into this intimate and ſweet union, until he ſhall have compleated us all in himſelf, to be made, all of us, one day, all in God, after he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up his Kingdom to his Father,</hi> Ut ſit Deus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia in omnibus; That God may be all in all: <hi>And we enter into this bleſſed union, with the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

But that I muſt ſeek my entry to God, and to our Saviour, in the Communion of Saints: Whereupon I was on an inſtant poſſeſſed with a wonderful preſence, of the reſpect and love, and union of the B. Virgin, the Angels and Saints, which I am not able to expreſs, nor to utter the greatneſs and ſolidity of this grace: For this union is Life Eternal, and the Eccleſiaſtical Paradiſe; and this union is both for the Saints in Heaven, and thoſe on earth, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always in full view and preſence.</hi>

This meditation left me in the love, and in the true and experimental connexion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and communication of Saints; yet with a due order of thoſe to whom I am more united, which is

                  <head>CHAP. 7. <hi>His devotion to the Holy Sacrament.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ONe of the greateſt Devotions of this holy man, was, that to the H. Euchariſt, conſidered both as a Sacrifice, and as a Sacrament; of which he had ever an incredible eſteem, honouring it with all poſſible reverence, and affecting it with tender love, bleſſing and praiſing God for its inſtitution, and exciting, both by his word and pen, the whole world to do the ſame.</p>
                  <p>He was accuſtomed to ſay, that it was inſtituted, to ſtay and place our Saviour, God and Man, in the midſt of us, to obtain for us, all the benefits of grace, whereof we are capable here, and to diſpoſe us for thoſe of glory. That the great deſign of God, in the Incarnation, the Life, Death and Reſurrection of his Son, was to convey unto us his Spirit, to be unto us Life Eternal; which Spirit he hath taught us by his Word, merited for us by his Death, &amp; doth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon us from his eſtate of Glory. And the better to convey this unto us, to cauſe us to live thereby, and dye in our ſelves, he giveth himſelf to us in this moſt Holy Sacrament, dead, raiſed up, and glorified, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in us, by the operation of his Spirit, theſe two effects of death and life.</p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:115611:153"/>
                  <p>He was not onely preſent every day at Maſs, but took it for a great honour to ſerve the Prieſt himſelf: He received every day, if not hindred by very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant buſineſs, or ſome preſſing occaſion of Charity. And as the honour we render to this B. Sacrament, conſiſts not in often receiving, but in communicating well and perfectly; he took all care thereof, that could be expected from one of ſo holy life, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Piety.</p>
                  <p>He ſpent many hours, in prayers, upon his knees, before the Bleſſed Sacrament. And being once asked by a friend, How he could remain there ſo long? He anſwered, That there he recreated his ſpirit, receiving from thence refreſhment and new forces; and yet ſometimes he encountred with ſome trouble in that Devotion, which may be gathered from this Letter to his Director, dated the 27 of <hi>June,</hi> in the year, 1647.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have been very poor all this moneth, I know not whether I was ever ſo lumpiſh, both in ſpirit and body, as I was upon the Feſtival day of the Bleſſed Sacrament. I was preſent at Service, at Proceſſion at Maſs, at Communion, heard the Sermon, at Veſpers, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; but like a very beaſt, not knowing how to demean my ſelf, either kneeling, or ſtanding, I was in a kinde of reſtleſs condition of body, and very wandring and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted in ſpirit; onely I knew well, that in the bottom of my ſoul. I had a deſire to honour God through his Son Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After Compline, I found my ſelf ſo dull and heavy, that ſeeing my ſelf unable to remain before the Bleſſed Sacrament, for I fell all along, I reſolved to try, whether
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115611:153"/>upon retiring, and refreſhing my ſelf a little, I ſhould be any better: But for all that, I found my ſelf more tired and diſcompoſed in body and minde, than if I had had the courage to have lain there ſtill all along upon the ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hereupon I reflected upon what I had formerly read, in a Paper you ſent me concerning a certain vertuous perſon, afflicted with the like ſtupefaction: Whereupon I roſe up, and ſet my ſelf under the Crucifix, before the Holy Sacrament, determining to honour my Saviour in all conditions and tempers. Being thus upon my knees, by the Divine aſſiſtance, I got the victory over my ſelf, and my ſpirit was enlarged: Whereupon I received from the Bleſſed Sacrament this illumination, That to become Bread (which hath relation to that Myſterie) I muſt firſt be ground, like the corn, than kne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ded with water, and laſtly, baked in the even. And that this was the right way to be incorporated into that myſtical Bread, our Lord and Saviour; and at the ſame inſtant that this was revealed unto me, I felt in my ſelf, a vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be thus dealt with, which hath remained in me ever ſince. And now I underſtand, that to enter into a Spiritual eſtate, we muſt, like the corn, before we be ſent to the mill, be firſt threſhed, and winnowed from our earthly impurities, and that the grain is not fit for uſe, till it be pure, and that it becomes not fruitful, till it firſt dyeth in the ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The meditation upon this material Bread, hath taught me great Myſteries (during this Octave) of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bread in the Sacrament;</hi> viz. <hi>how that Jeſus Chriſt, being bruiſed and broken in his Paſſion, giveth himſelf to us for food, to the end that we might ſet forth and expreſs, his Death, his Lnve, and Vertues in our
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115611:154"/>life. And in this condition I now finde my ſelf much in love with Jeſus Chriſt, deſirous to be wholly to him, and to render unto him in my affliction, this which he hath given me, and my goods, and my body, and my ſoul, and my time, and my eternity. I have a great thirſt upon me to ſerve him, and other longings, which I reſerve to communicate, until I have the happineſs to ſee you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This his ſingular affection to the B. Sacrament, cauſed him to write in Capital Letters upon a Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney piece, in his Caſtle at <hi>Citry, Bleſſed for ever be the moſt Holy Sacrament of the Altar:</hi> This made him walk on foot, to viſit all Churches within two leagues round about him, to ſee in what decency the B. Sacrament was reſerved there; and to beſtow in ſeveral parts, a great number of ſilver pixes, to keep it in, upon poor Pariſhes; and Tabernacles likewiſe, which he made, &amp; gilded with his own hands, having a great dexterity in all ſuch Manual works. Of which he writ ſomething to me, the 26 of <hi>September,</hi> in the year, 1646.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Since Advent, I began a work, which I have deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this long time;</hi> viz. <hi>at ſuch times, as my urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions will give leave, which commonly is after ſupper, till prayer time, to practice ſome handicraft work; where having all my tools, I make Tabernacles for the B. Sacrament; and if I finiſh but one in a moneth, my time will not be ill ſpent; for they may be ſerviceabe to ſome poor Churches that want them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Guided by the ſame zeal, in the year, 1641. he caſt to ſet up, in his Pariſh of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> a company of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Ladies, every one in their turn, to ſpend an hour
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115611:154"/>in prayer every afternoon, before the Sacrament. He wrote a ſhort Treatiſe of the conduct of this Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the grounds of undertaking it; the cheif whereof was, upon the conſideration, that our Saviour being continually in this adored Myſterie: to give himſelf to us, it was therefore but reaſonable, that ſome perſons ſhould be preſent in the Church, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him their homage, and honour, and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to that his deſire, of giving himſelf to us. This Treatiſe he preſented with all humility and due reſpect to his Pariſh Prieſt, for his conſent, and the putting it in practice, if he thought it fitting; which was done accordingly, and continueth to this day with great edification and profit; and ſucceedeth ſo happily, that the like inſtitution is taken up in ſeveral other Pariſhes and Towns; as at <hi>Dijon,</hi> where Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> erected it, at his firſt journey thither, with great zeal and courage, overcoming ſeveral difficulties and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions againſt it.</p>
                  <p>He likewiſe excited ſeveral perſons in his Pariſh, to accompany the Holy Sacrament, when it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the ſick; in ſuch ſort, that a great company of men and women, were ſeen to follow our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, with lighted torches; where he attended like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with great diligence, notwithſtanding his daily employments, ſpending for a long while almoſt all the morning in this Holy Exerciſe, in all ſeaſons of heart and cold.</p>
                  <p>One day, amongſt other, being very foul, &amp; he much diſtempered with rheume, he was wiſh'd to forbear that time, being ſo very incommodious for him to walk bare-headed, to the great prejudice of his health All which moved him not a jot, but he went chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115611:155"/>thorow theſe difficulties; and which is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, at his return was cured of his rheume.</p>
                  <p>Another time, accompanying the H. Sacrament, a coach with ſix horſes paſſed by, without ſtopping, or ſaluting the ſame; whereupon he, ſuſpecting them to be ill-affected perſons, and much offended with their impietie, ſtirred up with zeal, to defend the honour of his Maſter, adventured to admoniſh them of their duty; and caſting himſelf before the horſes (with much hazard to his perſon) ſtayed the coach in its career, and engaged the perſons to do reverence thereto, by ſtaying till it was paſt; which heroick action, cauſed great admiration in all the beholders.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. 8. <hi>His Prayer.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis Chapter, and the next, contain ſome things in them, that cannot ſo well be expreſſed by way of Hiſtory, by reaſon that things of ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult nature, muſt be dilated upon, to make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</p>
                  <p>In this Chapter we ſhall ſpeak of his Prayer, which we may fitly term the large channel which conveys the gifts of God into our ſoul; the moſt certain means for procuring of help, and all graces requiſite to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the moſt univerſal inſtrument, whereof we ſerve our ſelves in our ſpiritual life, to perform all the functions thereof for our advancement in the Purgative way, for rooting out vices in the Illuminative way,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115611:155"/>for the practice of vertue; and in the Unitive, for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving unto an union with God, in which conſiſteth our perfection. All the Saints that ever were, have ſet ſo high a value upon this Divine action, that quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as it were, all other affairs, they have paſſed their days and nights in prayer; many having left their Crowns and Scepters, and retired into Monaſteries and Solitudes, to have the honour to converſe with God more ſecretly, and for longer time.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>de Renty</hi> enlightned by their beams, and treading in their ſteps, gave himſelf to this exerciſe, with ſuch care and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igence, that we may aver, this to have been his ordinary employment, and his whole life a trade of praying.</p>
                  <p>I mean not here his vocal Prayers, having ſpoken of them before: I affirm, that his affection was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great to mental Prayer, underſtanding well the neceſſity thereof, as that whereby we come more intimately to know, and reap the benefit of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian verities; which until they be known, are not at all beneficial; and the utility thereof, to learn a man what he is, and enable him to exerciſe the real acts of vertue, in the inward life and ſpirit of them; elevating the ſoul to a familiar conference with God; an honour more incomparably glorious, though but for one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, than is the moſt intimate communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the greateſt Monarchs for whole years together; like as we eſteem it a greater honour, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe freely and familiarly with a King, the ſpace of one hour, than many years with a Peaſant.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, he well underſtood the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this Prayer, and how it aſcends by four ſteps. The firſt is Prayer of Reaſoning and Diſcourſe. The
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115611:156"/>ſecond, that of the Will and Affections. The third, that of Union or Contemplation; which divides it ſelfe into two branches; <hi>viz.</hi> in Contemplation active or acquiſite, and Contemplation paſſive or infuſed; which paſſive Contemplation, is the fourth and higheſt round of this ladder of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Prayer of the Underſtanding, and of Diſcourſe, or Meditation, is an application of the Spirit, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſome vertues of his ſalvation, which he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended not before; reaſoning and diſcourſing thereon within himſelf, ruminating upon its cauſes, effects, and circumſtances of time, place, manner, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons belonging to it, to draw from thence arguments of good life; going from one circumſtance and point to another, from the cauſes to their effects, and ſo backward, which is called reaſoning; and, becauſe our minde is quick and ready in this operation; not onely nimble to go, but run in it, therefore it is termed alſo diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>He began at this ſtep, and made ſome ſtay upon it, where indeed every one ought to begin, and reſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he is called by God to another; becauſe the moſt proper and naturall way, that God hath given men, to come to underſtand and affect any thing, is that of Conſideration and Reaſoning; wherefore each one muſt ſerve himſelf herewith, till he be advanced higher.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary ſubject which he took for theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, were the Life, Paſſion, and Death of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: Which without all contradiction, is the moſt profitable of all others, ſince he is ſet before us for our pattern; in the imitation and expreſſion whereof conſiſts our perfection, and life eternal.</p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:115611:156"/>
                  <p>After ſome time, having been faithful in this firſt ſtage, he paſſed to the ſecond, that of will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being called with an <hi>Amice, aſcende ſuperius; Friend, fit up higher:</hi> Not unlike a Scholar, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a good proficient, is ſet up to a higher claſs of deeper learning. For he ſpent not all his days in Grammar, but ſtudied to proceed from one Science to another, till he arrived to perfection.</p>
                  <p>This Prayer of Affection, is a familiar and paſſionate treaty betwixt Chriſt and the Soul, wherein very little or no diſcourſe is uſed; or a ſincere communication with God, as preſent and reſident within us; in which the ſoul quitteth all reaſonings and diſputes, and by a ſimple direct contemplation, and thinking upon God, is carried on to him, and enflamed with the deſires of praiſing, bleſſing, adorning and glorifying him, with ſeveral elevated acts of grace, oblation, petition, and above all, of Love, the Queen of other Vertues, moſt acceptable to, and moſt glorious in the ſight of God, moſt advantagious to our ſelves, enabling us with power, to ſurmount all difficulties, to practice all good works, and uniting us more intimately to God.</p>
                  <p>This, I ſay, the Soul performs without diſcourſe, in regard that the underſtanding being ſufficiently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with light from her former meditations, hath no need to ſtudy new arguments or motives to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce love, and other neceſſary affections, but may ſerve herſelf of the former ſtore.</p>
                  <p>The way to practiſe this, is firſt of all, to retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecret cabinet of our heart, applying our ſelves to God, who reſideth there, not by reaſon and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but by faith, ſtedfaſtly believing his Divine preſence, with all his perfections: And in order to this
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115611:157"/>firm aſſurance, to preſent our ſelves before him, with profound reverence and adoration, abaſing our ſelves, out of reſpect to his infinite greatneſs, and the ſenſe of our own vileneſs, in the light of thoſe words of <hi>David, Domine, quis ſimilis tibi? Quid eſt homo quod memor es ejus; Lord, who is like unto thee? What is man that thou art mindeful of him?</hi> or that he ſhould dare to appear before thee?</p>
                  <p>Keep your ſelf before him with theſe affections of Reverence and Humility, and remain there for ſome conſiderable time, the better to imprint them upon your ſoul; for ſuch time will be very well ſpent, and continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it yet longer, if you finde your heart dilated and melted with theſe affections.</p>
                  <p>After this, ſhutting out all ruminating, and reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the ſubject you deſire to be employed upon (as for example, ſuppoſe it be this, that God is all in all, and your ſelf are leſs than nothing, that he is your Soveraign Lord, and ultimate end, that he hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care of every thing that concerns you, that our Saviour dyed for you, and the like) employ your ſelf hereon by faith, in a moſt ſimple naked manner, reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating acts of a lively faith, of ſuch a truth, which the Church hath taught you; and after this, an act of Hope, or of Praiſe, or Thankſgiving, or Contrition for your ſins, or of any other paſſion the ſoul ſhall be more diſpoſed to; but eſpecially of love, taking care that theſe affections have an influence upon your will and manners, to produce in them a happy altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the directions we are to obſerve in this ſecond degree of Prayer, which therefore is called Prayer of Gods preſence, and of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ith, and of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:115611:157"/>
                  <p>Wherein alſo two things are carefully to be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Firſt, that it is not requiſite in this prayer, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe at the ſame time ſeveral paſſions; but rather one, as Hope, Love, or any other, well-grounded and proſecuted is ſufficient: And the rea on is plain, becauſe ſo long as God gives to the ſoul, the grace to produce acts of any one vertue, in ſuch a manner, as that ſhe findes herſelf diſpoſed and preſſed thereto, and to exerciſe the ſame with eaſe, this is an evident token, that it is his will that ſhe ſhould ſerve and honour him, ſhould ſanctifie and perfect herſelf by the ſame; and that ſhe ought to continue therein, ſo long as ſhe findes that ſuccour graciouſly aſſiſting her. Moreover, on the ſouls part, it would argue want of diſcretion, to quit ſo good and profitable an exerciſe, ſo powerfully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in it, and it made ſo eaſie to her, by that Divine aſſiſtance; and fall upon another, that is likely to prove difficult, for want of the ſame aſſiſtance: Whence we may conclude, that we ought not to change our exerciſe of Piety, ſo long as God ſupplies us with ſufficient grace to attend it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, that we ſhould reiterate many act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſame vertue; as of Faith, Hope, Love, or (which is better) continue and hold on the ſame act; thus, to acquire a rooting and eſtabliſhment of theſe vertues, which is not gotten but by vigo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ous and effectual reiteration of their acts; as, a nail is not driven up to the head, with one blow, but muſt be ſtrucken hard and often. And ſo it is with vertues, whoſe force and ſound profit, conſiſts in their having a well-rooted and grounded poſſeſſion of the ſoul; whereas, they are worth little or nothing, till they are habituated therein; even as the tree brings forth
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115611:158"/>neither leaves nor fruits, until it hath taken deep rooting.</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing is to be done for any moral conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which are drawn from theſe acts (that is) to double and redouble them, till they be fixed and made effectual; as for example, after ſome repeated acts of Faith, that God is your firſt Principle, and that of your ſelf you are nothing, and that all your hope is in him, and our Saviour; ſay with your ſelf, once, twice, and twenty times over, with affection, and a quiet, but vigorous application; if I believe this great truth of God and my ſelf, why do I attribute any thing to my ſelf? why do I not humble and abaſe my ſelf under him? why do I not love him, upon whom all my good depends? why do I not look upon my ſelf, and all creatures in the world, as nothing? If I hope in God, and my Saviour, why then do I fear any thing elſe? is not here ground enough to live with confidence and joy? what is he that can moleſt or trouble me? Live then, O my ſoul, in tranquillity and repoſe, as this ſame hope doth oblige thee. Theſe acts thus redoubled, and repeated with conſtancy and vigour, will without doubt produce great effects in the ſoul; which is the fruit that this Prayer of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould bring forth.</p>
                  <p>Herein did Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> exerciſe himſelf for many years, reaping thereby an ineſtimable treaſure of ſpiritual riches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Prayer</hi> (ſaith he in one of his Papers) <hi>is not by diſcourſe and reaſoning, but by a loyal love, tending always to give more, than to receive. The obſcurity of Faith is of greater evidence to the ſoul, than all the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115611:158"/>ſhe can procure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; which faith ſhe ought to uſe with Reverence and Thanksgiving, not with Complacency or Affectation: Here needs no ſtretch of the Spirit, this Prayer never offends the brain; this is a ſtate of modeſt deportment, in which the ſoul keeps herſelf in the preſence of God; expecting what his ſpirit ſhall pleaſe to infuſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, which we receive in ſimplicity, and in conſidence, as if himſelf ſpake to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ordinary diſpoſitions with which he entred into this Prayer; were firſt, A profound Reverence, and an abaſing of himſelf in Gods preſence, whoſe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Majeſte held him in a deep ſenſe of his own meanneſs, ſaying, that we ought to conſider our ſelves before it, as little, and leſs than the ſmalleſt Atomes. Secondly, A ſtrong and abſolute Confidence in his Infinite Goodneſs and Mercy, which bearing up his Humility, and the ſenſe he had of his own vileneſs, made him ſtill hope all things.</p>
                  <p>He exhorted all of his acquaintance, that were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, to uſe this kinde of Prayer, as the moſt excellent, profitable, and eaſie of all others; ſince it puts not a man to the labor to conſider, nor pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into, or diſcourſe of any ſubject; but is eaſie for all ſorts, but chiefly for the unlearned, who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have need of no more, but a ſimple belief, applying themſelves thereto with Affection.</p>
                  <p>He counſelled men to give themſelves more to the operations of the will, than the ſpeculations of the underſtanding; and that place of S, <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> where he exhorts us to live in ſobriety, he expounded of the ſobriety of the ſenſes, and chiefly of that of the Spirit, to cut off in our prayers multiplicity
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115611:159"/>of notions and diſcourſe, and to proceed therein by Faith.</p>
                  <p>In effect, the myſterie of faith is incomparably tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent above all the Science and Diſcourſe of the moſt quaint and ſublime wits; for as every thing is but viſible by his own light, a Torch by his, and the Sun by the Sun; things of glory by the light of glory, ſo thoſe of grace by the light of grace; whereof the moſt perfect, without doubt, is that of Faith. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is beſtowed upon us for the diſcovery of natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al things, and Faith for Supernatural and Divine: With men we diſcourſe by Reaſon, and with God by Faith; and ſince God is at an infinite diſtance above man, and Grace above Nature, we may well conclude, that Humane diſcourſe of the fineſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, is too heavy for that high pitch, which can ſoar no further than natural Reaſon can conduct it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, whatſoever notions we have in this world of God, and things ſpiritual, they are in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree deceitful and falſe, not repreſenting things as they are really; ſince our ſpirit conceives nothing here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but what hath paſſed thorow the ſenſes, where ſpiritual things are refracted, and receive much earth, and come to us diſtorted and diſguiſed: But it is Faith alone that repreſents them in their real entities.</p>
                  <p>There are but two indubitable lights, on which we may relie, and which ſurpaſs all others in excellency, which ſanctifie and deifie our underſtanding, elevating it to its firſt principle, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iginal of all verity; which is the Divine Intellect; that is to ſay, the light of Faith here, and the light of glory hereafter: Theſe two being participations of that knowledge which God himſelf hath, which demonſtrates the dignity and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115611:159"/>perfection of Affective Prayer, which quitting Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, proceeds by Faith.</p>
                  <p>Neither did he make long ſtay upon the former way of Prayer, but paſſed on further, aſcending to that of Union and Contemplation; which was beſtowed upon him in a very high degree. Holy men ſpeaking of this Contemplation, the ſublimeſt degree of Prayer here upon earth, make thereof two ſorts, <hi>Acquiſite</hi> and <hi>Infuſed:</hi> The latter is, that which God alone produceth in the ſoul, to which ſhe contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a ſimple conſent, to receive his operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is alſo called Contemplation <hi>Paſſive.</hi> The former is, that which man, aſſiſted by Gods grace, may acquire by his own labour, and exerciſe by his own induſtry, and is therefore called <hi>Active.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Infuſed, hath ſo abſolute a dependence upon God, that its given when, and to whom he pleaſeth; who alſo takes it away, which we cannot hinder, no more than all the men in the world, with all their ſtrength, put together, can ſtay the Sun from riſing and ſetting. But all are in ſome meaſure capable of the other; and it is a ſingle contemplation of God, or any other ſubject, without diſcourſe, ſweetly moving the will with holy affections, and particularly with that of Love: It is a quiet, pleaſant operation of the ſoul, ſetting her in full view of her object; a ſilent proſpect of Faith, accompanied with Reverence, Eſteem, Gratitude, Confidence, and chiefly with Love,</p>
                  <p>When you viſit a ſick friend, beholding him in bed, ſuffering extreamly, toſſing and turning, tormented, and groaning; and this fight of ſuch a loving friend, toucheth you deeply with the ſenſe of compaſſion,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115611:160"/>with an earneſt deſire to comfort him, and a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing in his ſuffering, this is Contemplation; for you behold all this without reaſoning, with one direct view, which affects you, and makes theſe impreſſions upon you. So when you behold our Saviour praying in the Garden, with his face to the earth, all over in a bloody ſweat; or bound at the Pillar, covered with ſtripes; or nailed on the Croſs, dying betwixt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of pain and infamy; and this ſerious, but ſimple attention, without any formal diſcourſe, affects you with compaſſion and admiration, with compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for your ſins, with hope and love: This is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. Again, when <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> ſits at our Saviours feet, liſtening to his bleſſed words, with the ear of faith; or looking up to him upon the Croſs, and believes this to be the Son of God, her Redeemer, who pardoned her ſins, obliged her with ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, teſtified ſo great good will to her, and now ſuffereth ſo much for her; and when from this ſpring there flows from her a torrent of tears, out of the bowels of Love, Gratitude, and Contrition: This is Contemplation.</p>
                  <p>The uſe then of this Contemplation, Active and Acquiſite, conſiſts, in entring into the bortom of our ſouls, and there in the preſence of God quitting all ſenſe and diſcourſe, applying our ſelves by faith, and affections of the will, to ſome one of the Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or ſome myſterie of our Saviour, viewing it with attention, and the eyes of Faith, of Reverence, Affiance, and Love, without reaſoning, and alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out multiplying a quantity of different affections at one time, fixing our ſelves upon this attentive and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate regard, which alſo ought to be ſo naked,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115611:160"/>and abſtracted from all ſolicitude and reflexion upon any things elſe, as wholly to forget them, as much as is poſſible; to be taken up wholly, and buſied in liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Saviour, with <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> who ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at his feet, ſpake not one word, and though blamed by her ſiſter, anſwered nothing, thinking onely upon hearing and attending on our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>The ſoul in Contemplation muſt be ſilent to all creatures, and ſpeak onely with God. The ſoul uſeth to ſpeak to the creatures four ways; by her Undeſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in thinking of them; by her Will, in affecting them; by her Imagination, in forming images of them; by her Paſſions, in deſiring them: and all this ſhe doth without language, or the help of her Exteriour ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>So that the words ſhe utters, are thoughts which ſhe placeth upon them, and affections which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth, and Idaea's which ſhe formeth, and deſires which ſhe produceth towards them.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the ſoul is ſilent, and ſpeaks not a word, when ſhe ceaſeth to apply herſelf to them by theſe faculties; and when ſhe is not buſied about them by thoſe operations, but ceaſeth from all acts that relate to them; inſomuch, that having no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them, ſhe remains in ſuch a ſtate, as if there were nothing elſe in the world but God and ſhe, to whom alone ſhe ſpeaketh in this myſtical ſilence, of which S. <hi>John</hi> is underſtood, when he ſpeaks of a ſilence in heaven, that is, in the ſoul, when ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeth with God by her underſtanding, and by her will, producing acts of Faith, Hope, Love, Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Bleſſing, Glorifying, Thankſgiving, Union, and the like.</p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:115611:161"/>
                  <p>And ſhe is yet further ſilent, from time to time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaking at all to him no not after this noble way, and with this Divine language, but is liſtening and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to his ſpeeches, which ſometime may be arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate, but theſe intelligibly onely to herſelf; but more frequently are illuminations, by which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth her underſtanding; and certain impreſſions and motions, with which he teacheth her will, ſaying with <hi>David, andiam quid loquatur in me Dominus Deus, will hearken what the Lord ſaith within me;</hi> and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Samuel, Loquere Domine, quia audit ſervus tuus; Speak Lord, for thy ſervaut heareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Saviour teaching his Diſciples to pray, told them, and us in their perſons, <hi>Orantes, nolite, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum loqui; when you pray, uſe not many words;</hi> which he meant not onely of the words of the mouth, but likewiſe of underſtanding, and other faculties; Speak not much, but hearken diligently: He likewiſe calls himſelf <hi>Verbum,</hi> the Word, becauſe he muſt be liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, and that deſervedly; wherefore he ſaith to the ſoul, <hi>Audi Filia; Hearken, O my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Father <hi>Avila,</hi> who hath writ an excellent Treatiſe upon thoſe words, gives this for a weighty advice, that we ſhould go to prayer, to hear rather than to ſpeak; who alſo told <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> that writ his Life, how that when he went to his holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, he uſed to binde and tye up his underſtanding, like a fool, to the end that it might not talk much. We have certain ſouls, which in their prayers, talk all, as conceiving, that the myſterie conſiſts in talking much to God, and employing ſtill their faculties in working, without conſidering, that what God ſhall ſpeak to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115611:161"/>them, will be far better and more profitable than what they can ſpeak to him; even, as in our converſe with other men, we uſe not to talk continually, but after a few words, hearken to what they ſpeak: So in our prayers to our Saviour, let us after our ſpeaking to him, attend with ſilence to what he ſhall ſay to us. This is the courſe of active Contemplation, and prayer of Union; where we muſt mark its difference from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Diſcourſe, and prayer of Affection; in that theſe two faculties of the ſoul, the Underſtanding and Will acting all theſe three ſorts of prayer: The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding acts more than the Will in prayer of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; the Will more in prayer of Affection (where is to be noted, that thoſe who begin this prayer, are not in the entrance thereof, ordinarily, without ſon diſcourſe; but yet ſuch as goe on, diminiſhing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Whereupon Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> uſed to ſay,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it was the great imperfection of many ſouls, not to attend ſufficiently to God; the natural faculties being too buſie, and not ſubjecting themſelves to him, upon ſpecious pretences, thinking to do wonders; whereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they hinder him from working in the ſoul, whilst
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115611:162"/>he findes it in a ſtate of agitation and inquietude; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it ſhould be in tranquillity and ſilence, to receive his operations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay to me, that he conceives this cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off Diſcourſe, and this uſing of a naked Faith, and ſo great ſimplicity of operation, can do little, but rather loſeth time. To whom I reply, that it is quite the contrary, and time very well ſpent; for whilſt we quit the operations of ſenſe and diſcourſe, we diſmiſs that which keep us at a diſtance from God, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above all diſcourſe, and much more above ſenſe; but going on by faith, and the affections of the will, we approach neer to him.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> cleareth this doubt in one of his papers, ſaying;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some will ſay, often there occurs nothing to me in ſuch prayers, and I fear to ſpend my time in idleneſs: But know, that you loſe no time at all, when by loſing your ſelf, you are ſound in a ſtate of Reverence and Affiance in the preſence of God, to make your courſe towards him; nor can he diſlike ſuch a behaviour. Another will ſay, but I have had many diſtractions, and finde my ſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with great aridities, and many other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences. I anſwer, perſevere ſtill, notwithſtanding all theſe difficulties, in your view, of Faith and Reverence, and in your Affections, as much as you can, and keep your ſelf ſhut up in the cabinet of your heart: Suffer the noiſe of all theſe tempeſts without, without heeding them; after the example of</hi> Noah, <hi>who in the midst of his Ark, was quiet, as his very name imports, whilſt winds and waves beat upon him on every ſide. Thoſe
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115611:162"/>things are but neceſſary, and ſerve to purge and diſpoſe the ſoul for the operation of God upon it; even as green wood puffs and ſweats out its humidity, before it can burn: So, let theſe diſtractions, and all ſorts of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aſſault us, as it pleaſeth God, but let them not trouble or hinder us from this holy exerciſe, onely let us, diverting our minde from theſe miſeries, when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any, continue peaceably, and without noiſe, this our Sacrifice, with aſſurance that we ſhall not wait long before our Lord come unto us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And himſelf, when finding himſelf in ſuch ſterile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, would cry to God out aloud, when he was alone, I am yours, O my God, in deſpite of all theſe diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and aridities: I am yours, and will continue ſo without reſerve; you have created me, and I will love you for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometime he would write with his finger upon the ground, and ſometime upom his breaſt; ſaying,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am content with every thing that proceeds from the will of God, and with what he appoints for me: I ask nothing elſe, I will never trouble my ſelf to procure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, or to be freed from aridities, my reſolution is to bleſs God at all times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe he writ to his Director:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am now and then an hour or two at prayer, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing occurs to me: Sometime I am troubled with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, aridities, and laſſitude; but however it comes to paſs, I never end, but with a deſire to begin again; and often this laſſitude of body is relieved, and vaniſheth by an inward ſtrength, which is given me,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115611:163"/>and which diſpoſeth me to continue my Devotion out of the time and place of prayer, even in the midſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and buſineſs; and I tell you ſincerely, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I perform every thing ſo ill, yet I finde little difference of times for prayer, being recollected continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To another intimate friend he writ thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I was the other day three or four hours in the Church with great aridities, nothing occurring whereon to fix my ſelf: Behinde me I over-heard a good ſervant of God ſaying his prayers, with the</hi> Gloria Patri: <hi>I preſently offered up to God that which I heard him ſay; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon of a ſudden, it was diſcovered to me, that when the ſoul is alone in the deſart, where ſhe hath no creature to reſt upon, God caſteth down from heaven his line of love, to draw her up towards him; and ſomething to that effect I felt in my ſelf; and though nothing did occur to me, yet when I end prayer, I could willingly begin it afreſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much for active and acquiſite Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
                  <p>As for the paſſive and infuſed, as it depends abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely on God, ſo hath it no other rule but his will and good pleaſure, to communicate himſelf to a ſoul, illuminating the uderſtanding with tranſcendent light, and repleniſhing the will with ſtrong affections, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of love: Even as <hi>Moſes,</hi> that perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of all Contemplation, to make himſelf fit to aſcend Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> there to converſe with God, quitted his heards, and flocks, his people both great and ſmall, his brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> and even <hi>Joſhua</hi> his
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115611:163"/>ſervant, who was continually with him, and then went up alone to the point of the hill, where <hi>he entred into the dark cloud, in which God was,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith, and abode there fourty days in Contemplation, and intimate converſe with his Sacred Majeſtie; So muſt we, quit ſenſe, reaſonings, all ſenſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual things, to be admitted into true Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, which is tranſacted within the clouds of faith (where certainly God is) and by faith in our illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and affections. And here is to be noted, that all theſe ſublime contemplations and favours, muſt terminate in a ready diſpoſition of the ſoul, to the will of God, to render it carefully obſervant of his commandments; even as all thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> were, for the receiving of the Tables of the Law, and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into his hands; which yet were afterwards broken, to teach us by a figure, that the ſoul, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all thoſe diſpoſitions and helps to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is ſubject to failings, ſo feeble and neer to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice are we, with all theſe illuminations, unleſs God ſuſtain us.</p>
                  <p>The Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> inviteth ſouls in theſe amorous words, <hi>Comedite amici, &amp; bibite, &amp; ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briamini chariſsimi; Eat and drink, my friends, and be inebriated, you that are deareſt to me:</hi> Where by <hi>eating,</hi> which breaketh and cheweth the food, is meant meditation; by <hi>drinking,</hi> which ſwalloweth liquid things, prayer of affection; and by <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> active contemplation, or rather paſſive; which produceth the ſame effect in the ſoul, as drunkenneſs in the body, <hi>viz.</hi> loſs of reaſon, oblivion of all things, and mirth.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> was drawn, up thither by God, and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115611:164"/>elevated with <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the top of the Mountain of infuſed contemplation. Thus he writ to his Director in the year, 1645.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have not had this long time any uſe, neither at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor almoſt at other times, of the underſtanding, nor of memory; I neither ſee, nor feel any thing, have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guſt nor diſguſt of any thing, onely finde my will lively, and ready for every thing, that ſhall be ſhewed it by God, and for God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another Letter to him thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I finde for ſome time, that my prayer is no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: I poſſeſs the Sacred Trinity with a plenitude, of verity, and clearneſs, and this with ſuch an attraction ſo pure and ſo vigorous in the ſuperior part of my ſoul, that my outward employment create me no diverſion at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And another time he writ thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt worketh the experience of his Kingdom in my heart, and I finde him there my Lord and Maſter, and my ſelf wholly his: I diſcover now a greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of my heart, but ſo ſimple, that I am not able to expreſs it; ſave onely thus, that it is a ſimple, but moſt real ſight of the Trinity accompanied with praiſing, bleſſing, and offering up all homage thereto: All which is done ſo ſilently, that it cauſeth no noiſe below, neither can it be diſcerned in the higher part of my ſoul by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, ſo as to be expreſſed, except it be by reflexion: Whether I utter my ſelf well to you, or no, I know not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:115611:164"/>
                  <p>This bleſſed man, thus united by contemplation to God, the ſupream verity, received abondant light, both for himſelf and others, upon all ſubjects; but eſpecially thoſe he had for the underſtanding of the holy Scriptures, and eſpecially the New Teſtament, and therein the myſteries of our Saviour were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>Thus in a Letter to his Director:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon one word I ſhall read in the New Teſtament, I ſhall ſometimes diſcover notions of thoſe truths, in ſo full and piercing a manner, that I ever feel my body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed therewith, that is, my whole nature pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to one of his friends thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When I read the Sacred Scripture, I fortifie my ſelf to enter into thoſe effects they work, which is a plenitude of the truth of God, wherewith the ſoul is ſolidly and experimentally ſatisfied.</hi>

                  <p>And he made notes upon all the <hi>Lent</hi>-Goſpels, full of piety, and thoſe great illuminations, with which his ſpirit was repleniſhed.</p>
                  <p>This is a ſhort account of the Prayer of this great ſervant of God, ſo far as we could diſcover it; for the chief part thereof, is that which paſſed within the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of his own Soul, where his union and converſe with God was ſo wonderful, that after he had ſpent ſeven or eight hours therein, he found himſelf in the end, as if he had onely then begun it, except onely that he had then yet more deſire to continue it; and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115611:165"/>at length arrived to that height, that he never ended it at all, being wholly and conſtantly in recollection and application to God: Whereupon he profeſſed to an intimate friend, that he need neither particular place, nor time for prayer, ſince in all places, times and buſineſs, he continued it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. 9. <hi>The ſtate of his Myſtical Death and Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE are now come to the higheſt degree of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the ultimate diſpoſition of ſoul, to render her capable of a moſt intimate union with God, wherein her perfection conſiſts: She muſt dye firſt, before ſhe can live this new life, and muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, to become truly ſomething.</p>
                  <p>This death and annihilation ſtands not, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of mans naturals, to deprive him of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, memory, will, and affections, much leſs of his ſenſes; but in the ruine of the old man, which is wholly corrupt, and infected with ſin; in ſuch ſort, that the underſtanding and other faculties ſpiritual and corporal be cleanſed, and animated by the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, to work no more according to nature corrupted, nor yet nature pure, but nature elevated by grace, and ſanctified by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now as the corruption and malignity of the old man, holds an entire poſſeſſion of our nature, and the poyſon of ſin is ſpread all over body and ſoul, ſo that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115611:165"/>from the crown of the head, to the ſoul of the foot (as ſaith the Prophet) there is no ſound part in us: So all theſe parts muſt be healed, this corruption purged out, and the malignity perfectly mortified and deſtroyed. When I ſay perfectly, I mean, ſo much as this can be done here on earth; for it is onely in heaven, in the eſtate of glory, where this happineſs is compleatly perfected; but in this world, there will ſtill remain ſomething to be purged. This holy man, writing to one concerning this ſtate of death and annihilation, tells him, how that ſinging in the Church, with others, the <hi>Magnificat,</hi> he was illuminated upon theſe words, <hi>Depoſuit potentes de ſede, &amp;c. He hath put down the mighty from their ſeat, and hath exalted the humble;</hi> which repreſented to him a ſoul full of it ſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in the power and riches of its parts and natural endowments, in its life of Exterior and Interiour ſenſe, undertaking to ſee and underſtand every thing, full of it ſelf, and quite empty of God.</p>
                  <p>Then he addes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now our Saviour gave me to underſtand in this verſe, that he diveſteth this ſoul of her own proper arrogant ſpirit, rich in nothing but iniquity, that he humbles, and empties, and annihilates her, and ſo</hi> exalteth the lowly, <hi>advancing her at length to a wonderful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where I ſaw her reduced to an happy and rich anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, emptied of herſelf, and diſpoiled of what ſhe poſſeſſed, of ſenſe and man; diveſted not onely of the old man, but of the gifts of God that are in her, to be preſented before him in nakedneſs, and ſimple obedience. I underſtood, that in this eſtate, the ſoul being affected with great humility and affiance; likewiſe, God did in
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115611:166"/>her, that which he pleaſed, and that ſhe was throughly enlightned, and that ſhe diſcovered afar off the leaſt things, as we uſually do a little buſh in the midſt of a mown field.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He writ this following Letter to his Director upon the ſame ſubject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Since the time that I gave up my liberty to God, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my blood, as I told you: I was given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, to what a ſtate of annihilation the ſoul muſt be brought, to render it capable of union with him: I ſaw my ſoul reduced into a ſmall point, contracted and ſhrunk up to nothing: And at the ſame time, I beheld my ſelf, as if encompaſſed with whatſoever the world loves and poſſeſſeth, and, as it were, a hand removing all this far from me, throwing it into the occan of Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. In the firſt place, I ſaw removed all Exterior things, Kingdoms, great Offices, ſtately Buildings, rich Houſhold-ſtuff, Gold and Silver, Recreations, Pleaſures; all which are great encombrances to the ſouls paſsing on to God, of which therefore his pleaſure is, that ſhe be ſtripped, that ſhe may arrive at the point of nakedneſs and death, which will bring her into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſolid riches, and real life. Secondly, all Interior things, which are more delicate and precious; as, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Sciences, skill and ſublime Learning, operations of the Memory and strength of Vnderſtanding, humane Reaſon, experience of Senſe; of which the ſoul muſt likewiſe be purged, and dye to it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> own proper actions. And I perceived, that we muſt come like little Infants, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and innocent, ſeparated, not onely from evil, but even from our ordinary way and manner of doing that which
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115611:166"/>is good, undertaking what the Divine Providence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to us, by making our way by God to them, and not by them to God; which is a courſe more naked, unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and abſtracted; which ſees nothing but God: And not ſo much, if I may ſo ſay, as the things ſhe doth, of which nothing ſtays in her, neither choice, nor joy, nor ſorrow for their greatneſs, or for their littleneſs, for good or bad ſucceſs, but onely the good pleaſure and order of God, which ruleth in all things, and which in all things ſufficiently contenteth the ſoul, which adheres to him, and not to the viciſsitude of affairs, whereupon ſhe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly even, equal, and always the ſame in the midſt of all changes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another he writ thus to the ſame purpoſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An abſolute abnegation, will be neceſſary to all things, to follow in ſimplicity, without reſerve, or reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what our Saviour ſhall work in us, or appoint for us; let it be this or that: This way was ſhewed me, in which I ought to walk towards him; and hence it is that all things to me, ordinarily, are without any guſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, in another thus;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I apprehend great matters concerning the verity and ſimplicity of the annihilation I ought to have; and I had, for the twinkling of an eye, the ſight how ſimple this ſhould be, that the ſoul it ſelf cannot take notice of it: This is the ſtate of Death and Annihilation, without regard to any thing, ſave our being wholly to God, by Sequestration, Faith, and Affiance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:115611:167"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, to another:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſſure your ſelf, there is no ſecurity in any eſtate, but this, of Dying and Annihilation; which is, to be baptized into Chriſts death, that we may live the life of Mortification; not that other ways may not be good, but not ſecure; eſpecially any thing we do of our ſelves: Our beſt way is therefore, to diveſt our ſelves of all, that the Holy Infant Jeſus govern all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He uſed the word <hi>All,</hi> becauſe this death muſt be univerſal, thorow every part of old <hi>Adam;</hi> even as a dead body is not onely dead in an eye, or ear, or hand, but in every ſenſe and member; ſo much we dye to riches, and poverty, to pleaſure and pain, honour and diſhonour, praiſe and diſpraiſe being affected with none of theſe, becauſe we are dead to all: Moreover, the ſpirit muſt be dead, not onely to one faculty, as the Underſtanding or Will, but to all, and to every thing; onely the difference is this, that the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once deprived of her life, cannot naturally recover it again; but the Spirit will eaſily live again, and the malignity of the old <hi>Adam</hi> return upon us, if great heed be not taken; becauſe we are not able by this death, to reach the very centre of nature.</p>
                  <p>Juſt as in your Garden, you may either ſuffer a noyſom weed to grow, if you meddle not with it, but give it liberty to ſpread its leaves, and encreaſe, or if you would not have it appear, you may cut it, or pluck it up by the roots; but after all is done, you cannot prevent that the earth ſhould not produce the like, if it be thereto diſpoſed naturally: Even ſo it is in your power to permit unruly affections to live in your ſoul, producing therein diſorders, and exerciſing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115611:167"/>their tyranny; or you may mortifie them ſo, that they get not head, although the root remains; or further, may root them up, as heroick ſpirits do, changing their nature, and turning the courſe thereof, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing contrary inclinations, from evil to good, from vice to vertue; yet although theſe generous ſpirits arrive to this height, yet will their nature continue ſtill rotten at bottom, ready to bear the ſame curſed weeds, without our daily vigilancy.</p>

                     <p>TO decypher particularly the myſtical death of this renowned perſon; we may aver, That in the firſt place, he was dead to riches, and all the wealth of this world; in which he ſo abſolutely diveſted himſelf, both of any affection to them in his heart, and of the real poſſeſſion of them, that he quitted, as we have formerly mentioned, all property to them, uſing them no otherwiſe, than in the quality of a very poor man, with an ardent deſire that he might alſo be deprived of the very uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I acknowledge before God</hi> (ſaith he, in a Letter to his Director) <hi>his great mercy to me, through his Son, in freeing me from the things of this world: and my conſtant thoughts are, that if his order did not oblige me other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in that condition he hath ſet me, to give away and quit all I have: This is my earneſt deſire, after which I long exceedingly; not out of preſumption of my own
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115611:168"/>ſtrength, but in the power of Jeſus Chriſt, in imitation of his life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to another perſon he writ:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All that can be imagined in this lower world, is of ſmall concernment, though it were the loſing of all our goods, and the death of all the men in it: This poor Antchill, is not worthy of a ſerious thought, had we but a little faith, and a little love, how happy ſhould we eſteem our ſelves, in giving away all, to attend no more ſave on God alone; and to ſay,</hi> Deus meus &amp; omnia; My God and my all.</p>
                     <p>In his ſuit of Law at <hi>Dijon,</hi> he acted with ſo little ſhew of intereſt, and ſo like a mortified man to gain or loſs, that he could not be perſwaded not onely to ſolicite the Judges, but not ſo much as to commend his caſe to them himſelf; not out of any faulty ſupine indifferency, or neglecting what he thought abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary; but becauſe by an heroick vertue, he had loſt the ſenſe of all theſe earthly things, entirely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ſucceſs thereof to God; and knowing, that theſe things ſucceed better by our prayers to, and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in him, than with our addreſſes to men, through the multitude of ſolicitings, many times fruitleſs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he was dead and crucified to all recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pleaſures of this life; having renounced them at the beginning of his Converſion, remaining conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the condition of a ſacrifice of body and ſoul no God, which was his great exerciſe, and his uſual phraſe; making no further uſe of his ſenſes, and their objects, than what was of abſolute neceſſity, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein the pattern of our Saviour: He was ſo wholly
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115611:168"/>taken up with God (as we have ſaid before) in his ſoul, that when he had very grievous pains in his body, and was very ſick, he ſcarce thought upon them, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a trouble to ſpeak or complain thereof, as appeared notably in his laſt ſickneſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he was annihilated and dead to honour, his great birth and nobility, wherefrom he ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded himſelf in the arms of our Saviour, to render himſelf the more humble.</p>
                     <p>He was dead alſo to all eſteem and praiſe of men, and to diſgrace likewiſe; of which he gave a notable teſtimony to a familiar friend, who told him how much ſhe was troubled, to ſee him ſo much honoured and eſteemed by men: Who anſwered her:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, That ſhe had great reaſon for it, in that he ſo little deſerved it.</hi> And ſecondly, upon her demand, how thoſe commendations aſſected him: He replied, <hi>I neither attend, nor return any anſwer to them; they affect me no more than a ſtock, through the grace of God, I am inſenſible of praiſe and diſpraiſe; the one, nor the other make not any impreſsion upon my ſpirit, but I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them without reflexion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he had good reaſon, ſince'as all the prayers men beſtow upon us, make us not one jot the better, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their opprobries the worſe: Beſides that, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the diſtribution of theſe, the greateſt piece of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in the world is committed, by commending ſuch as leaſt deſerve it, but rather ſhame and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and blaming ſuch, whom God highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth place, he was dead and crucified to all
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115611:169"/>ſupernatural good things, all ſpiritual delights and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours (which without compariſon are of greateſt value, above all that we have named) even to all gifts, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, perfections, which he deſired and ſought after with a moſt diſengaged and ſelf-denying ſpirit, not luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this or that vertue, this or that degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but willing and deſiring all, according to Gods will; about which he expreſſed himſelf further thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The love of our ſelves is ſo afraid to be ſtripped out of any thing, that it ſuffers us not to be carried forth to our true reſt, as long as it can ſubſiſt and uphold it ſelf by its own right and property; which ſhould teach us, to uſe all diligence for the annihilation of our own deſires, even of thoſe that ſeem to us to tend onely to vertue: I ſay, that ſeem to us, whereas indeed if God gave us a true light, we ſhould undoubtedly ſee, that the courſe which tends to our diveſting of all theſe things, carries us on ſecretly, but moſt really, to the true poſſeſſion of them, and our own preſervation; and that we muſt daily deſcend to our own nothingneſs, in which alone God is to be found. Thrice happy are all ſuch poor in ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was alſo dead and annihilated to all guſts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, all ſenſible Graces and Conſolations, of which our love-ſick ſouls are ſo greedy: Upon which ſubject he expreſſed himſelf thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am better ſatisfied with thoſe graces in which ſenſe hath no part; than with thoſe that have more of the ſenſible; of which indeed, I am ſomewhat jealous; for we finde amongſt ſpiritual perſons, great ſtore of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115611:169"/>riches of the Spirit; thoſe, I mean, who are all for guſts, and ſenſible conſolations and illuminations, in this state of exile; wherein we ought to live rather by faith, than feeling, and which is much to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>And in another Letter thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As for obſcurities, aridities, and other troubles of ſpirit, they are to be born with upon any terms; and we muſt give up our ſelves as forlorn creatures, throwing our ſelves into God, on all ſides of us, as a fiſh in the Ocean, which is its proper element; into God, at all times and for all things: If we be true members of our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, we ſhall ſee nothing but ſubmiſſions and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negations, and ſhall ſenſe nothing elſe but theſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was dead and annihilated alſo to all glorious and extraordinary favours &amp; enjoyments; of which he had no other feeling, than the Sun, which being covered over with light, and crowned with glory, yet is no way ſenſible thereof; inſomuch, that having received by the mouth of a great Saint, promiſes of ſome great favours from God, he returned this anſwer to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector:</p>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:115611:170"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe things whereof they have given me notice and aſſurance, muſt be as they may, I reſt nothing upon them, nor confide in them, knnowing it to be my duty to live by faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Being certified at another time, of a ſpecial favour received from our Saviour, it had no other operation upon him, but the impreſſion of a great confuſion, and profound humility; And as they gave him all theſe things in writing at large, he parted with them all to his Director, together with all his other ſecrets, and moſt important papers of Devotion; eſpecialy thoſe written with his own blood, formerly mentioned; an evident demonſtration of his great humility, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that moſt men are taken with thoſe parcels of piety, grounding this their affection to them, upon ſome benefit receiveable by them: But the reliance which is placed upon God, muſt be diſengaged from every thing elſe. This he made appear by this Letter to his Director:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have received the paper, which mentions this grace and favour, whereof I ſend you the copy, having no other reflection thereupon, but to meet it with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt latitude of heart I can poſſible, to bleſs God, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his goodneſs, and ſerve him for it. I have burnt the original, with ſeveral other papers of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If you judge it not convenient that I ſhould do ſo, let me receive your commands accordingly for the future. I could wiſh (if there be any thing left for me to wiſh) that I had nothing left me but my God: This is the ſure repleniſhment of the ſoul, and rich treaſure of the heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:115611:170"/>
                     <p>Moreover, he was wholly dead to all that God wrought by him, taking no ſhare thereof, nor inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting himſelf any more with them after they were done, than if they had been performed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, he was crucified and dead to all affections, not onely ſuch as are irregular, but thoſe alſo which are purely natural of all creatures; and in particular, of thoſe who uſed his counſel, and depended upon him for the conduct of their ſouls; wherein the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and relations on both parts, uſe to be more than ordinary; inſomuch, that upon a ſeparation, there falls out de jection of ſpirit, and diſtractions of Devotion. To this purpoſe he writ to one of thoſe perſons, thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I cannot, without much trouble, bear the great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you make of my converſe, and of my removes: Let us breath after God, and make good our alliance with Jeſus Chriſte to learn in, and from him, a profound abnegation of our ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in another Letter thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is ever the ſame, and his grace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually advancing, and as long as I am to him, ſo long ſhall I be to you, for him, and in him; he is not wont to part ſouls, by the ſeparation of bodies; ſince his cuſtom is, to ſeparate onely what is imperfect, as being that which very often brings with it ſome hinderances to the perfect life of the ſpirit, which is never ſo compleat, as when it is alone.</hi>

Entring the Town, I underſtood the news from them, that ſpake openly of it in the ſtreets: Preſently I fixed my ſelf to the will of God, whereupon I found no more alteration in my ſoul, than if ſhe had been alive: I ſee his order in this, that I aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her not at her death, and make no doubt, but that he permitted it for her advantage.</hi>

                           </gap>d we experimentally finde, that we are not left destitute thereby, but that ſupply is made, either by
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115611:171"/>his Spirit, that reſideth continually in us, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; or by the conduct of his Miniſters, which the fewer they are, the more is that grace dilated and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, which we receive by them. So great is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of our Heavenly Father, as to take care of the meaneſt neceſſities of all his children, who to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves as children. Neither indeed ought we to be further engaged to thoſe perſons who aſſiſt us in our Spiritual conduct, than as to Gods inſtruments, whoſe help, it is his will we ſhould make uſe of, but no longer than he pleaſeth; and when his will is, either by death, or otherwiſe, to take them from us, we ought not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, nor loſe our courage; but, with ſubmiſsion and gratitude, reſign all to him, which will be a good means to move him to provide others, who perhaps with more advantage to us, may underſtand the pulſe of our ſouls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, he was dead to all love of himſelf; which he had ſo perfectly ſubdued, that being naturally quick and haſty (as we have formerly hinted) he became ſo ſtaid and equal in all his demeanor, as cauſed admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe that knew him; being naturally of a high ſpirit, he had acquired a moſt profound humility of heart, whereof he produced moſt evident acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exteriourly, at all times, and in all places: And though his genius inclined him to wit and ſcoffing, yet he ſo corrected it, that none was more reſpectful and courteous to all, even the meaneſt: As for his paſſions, thoſe were ſo perfectly ſubdued and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that they never broke looſe upon any occaſion; ſo that you might ſay, he had none at all.</p>
                     <p>He had arrived to a perfect death in the ſuperiour faculties of his ſoul; his memory ſo emptied of all
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115611:172"/>worldly things, that it never preſented any Idea's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſtract his Devotions: He made not any imperfection upon what was paſt; as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and our Saviour had endowed him with this ſingular grace, not to be buſied in his thoughts about thoſe actions, in which he was converſant; which after they were done, were obliterated wholly, as to any care for them, and quite blotted out of his memory, that they might be no hindrance to what was in hand.</p>
                     <p>This Letter was writ to a familiar friend, relating hereunto.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He was dead to his ſpirit, reaſon, and judgement, living onely the life of Faith, which is a Chriſtians proper death. It may be gathered from what hath been mentioned already, that he acted nothing by this faculty of its ſelf, no more than if he had had no ſuch power, but wrought all by the moving of Chriſt Jeſus, who lived in him, and operated by him.</p>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:115611:172"/>
                     <p>Laſtly, he was annihilated and dead to his own will; which we have placed after all, as being the moſt important faculty in relation to Moral actions: This therefore he had entirely reſigned, in conformity to Gods will, not deſiting abſolutely any thing, but in order thereto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I adore</hi> (ſaith he, in one of his Letters) <hi>ſo affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately the will of God, in whatſoever he pleaſeth to make out for me, that Hell it ſelf ſhould be my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, if he decreed me thither.</hi>

                        <hi>Far be it from me, to act in this buſineſs by my own ſpirit, I would have it wholly annihilated, that it might know no other language but</hi> Nothing, <hi>and continually</hi> Nothing, <hi>to follow in all the footſteps of the Divine will, according to its meaſure and manner.</hi>

                        <hi>My Saviour hath graciouſly brought me into ſuch a ſtate of indifferency for every thing, that I could be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well cortent all my life, to be fixed to my bed a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytique, not able to ſtir, without making any reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon any ſervice I might render to my neighbour, or that I could render him no more; all things, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God, being equal to me.</hi>

                     <p>One of his intimate friends, deſirous to try one day whether he had an affection to any thing, queſtioned with him about every thing he could think of, to put him to the reſt, and, among other things, asked him, whether he deſired not that theſe works which he had undertaken for the glory of God, might ſucceed and take effect. To whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he replied, that he had no other aim in all his actions and enterprizes, than the accompliſhing of the will of God; and that although
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115611:173"/>he uſed his utmoſt endeavour that ſuch things might ſucceed, yet notwithſtanding, he was perfectly reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all things to his Majeſties good pleaſure; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many other expreſſions, teſtifying his Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to all deſires, and a perfect transformation of his will into that of Gods. This diſcourſe was not quite finiſhed, but there hapned an occaſion to put it to the tryal; for one came running in, crying, that all the Heaven was on fire; which news, uſually very frightful, made no alteration in him at all, who moſt calmly and compoſedly looking up to the heavens, ſaid, the fire is here in <hi>Paris,</hi> without any further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though he underſtood preſently that it was ſo violent, that the ſtreet he lived in, was in danger to be burnt down, and his neighbours ſaid, it was neceſſary to quite forſake their quatters, by reaſon that the fire was not far off, and was likely in a very ſhort ſpace to reach them. In this publique fright, he keeping his ordinary equality, and referring all to the will of God, went into his Chappel, where he continued long time in prayer, offering up himſelf in ſacrifice to God, and reſigning up his own will unto him; ſome perſons looking upon him with great admiration in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; whilſt ſo many hundreds were at their wits end, and preparing for a ſpeedy flight.</p>
                     <p>He profeſſed to another ſecret and familiar friend, that he felt himſelf, through the mercy of God, in ſuch an abſolute ſtate of death to every thing, that neither Angels, nor men, the loſs of all he had, the ſubverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his family, nor any other accident could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from his ſettled tranquillity: And this he ſaid, not hyperbolically, or by way of oſtentation, but out of a ſolid experimental eſtabliſhment in that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115611:174"/>fortitude, common with him to all great Saints.</p>
                     <p>Such was the myſtical death and annihilation of this man of God, by which his ſoul was enriched with a vaſt treaſure of ſpiritual wealth, cauſing him to lead a moſt perfect life, and uniting him moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately to God, to which this death is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; becauſe no being can arrive to that which it was not formerly, without ceaſing firſt to be what it was; as, wood cannot paſs into the nature of fire, as long as it keeps its former nature; this muſt be quitted, and the matter be diveſted of all the form of wood, both in ſubſtance and accidents, and reduced into a ſtate of privation, to be made capable of the fires unitement to it. And this is a general rule in nature, admitting no exception, that each ſubject muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to receive a new form, and ſo much more, as this form is more noble; and this diſpoſition conſiſts in the privation of the ſubject, and loſs of other forms, to gain a new one: So alſo to make a ſpiritual man, he muſt no more live according to nature; but that he may be capable to be united to God, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily dye, and be annihilated to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>And if fire require this total privation in the matter, to communicate it ſelf thereto; with greater reaſon doth God, who is altogether a ſpirit, infinitely pure, the firſt and ſoveraign entity, require of a man this univerſal nakedneſs and privation, this death and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation to himſelf, and all created beings, before he give and unite himſelf with him; for in giving himſelf, he giveth alſo the fruition of himſelf, of his beauty, goodneſs, wiſdom, and his other perfections, and by this union renders the receiver happy.</p>
                     <p>Hence alſo may be gathered, what admirable purity
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115611:174"/>is requiſite in a ſoul, for this union with God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the ſtate of glory; that for this we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſerve our Baptiſmal Innocence; or if that hath been loſt or fullied, we muſt be purged here, or in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, by ſevere penances, notwithſtanding our other good works, and the high degrees of ſanctity to which we have attained.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame, in proportion, may be averred of the ſoul here in this eſtate of grace, where it muſt be very pure, to prepare it well for its union with God here in this life: And ſeeing her pollution ariſeth from her love to the creature, and to herſelf, and from the life of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> according to the luſts and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of our own ſpirit, it muſt dye to all theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and likewiſe to its ſelf; juſt as the body to be made perfect, and to partake the true life of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and bliſs, muſt neceſſarily dye firſt; ſo likewiſe muſt our ſouls, if we will have them arrive to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſiſting in this union with God, to lead a holy and Divine life, which alone can truly be called life.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe he writ thus to his Director:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſee clearly, that the onely way to a Divine Union, is to be perfectly diveſted of every thing that is not God, and dead to our ſelves, and every creature: O that I well underſtood the importance of this nakedneſs and death! and what is it that hinders the bonds of this Celeſtial love and union with his Divine Majestie, and that Soveraign Beauty, but a certain ſhew of, and light adherence to ſome creature? and ſhall we ſuffer that a thing ſo ſmall, and ſo unworthy, ſhould poſſeſs in the room of God, and that Holy Spirit, which is an all-conſuming
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:115611:175"/>fire of love, invirancing us on all ſides, ſhould not have the power to work upon us the ſame effect, which this elementary fire worketh upon wood? Why ſhould not I vicious and diſcontented creature, in the midſt of theſe my wretched plenitudes, acquire happineſs in the poſſeſſion of God, which I may do by his grace, in ſeparating my ſelf gently from the creature, by a ſingle and affectionate application to the Creator.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To another perſon he writ, thus:</p>

To this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſets our Saviour for our pattern; of whom he ſaid in the former part,</hi> Exinanivir ſeipſum; He emptied himſelf. <hi>If you ask how long, and to what degree?

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115611:175"/>giving me to underſtand, that the treaſure hidden in the field, mentioned in the Goſpel, is no other but this eſtate of Death and Annihilation, taking away from us our ſelves, to give us to God, emptying us of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be repleniſhed with the Creator, the Fountain of all good. Our Saviour tells us there, that he that found it, went and ſold all to buy it: If we underſtood the true value of this precious treaſure, we would freely part with our liberty, with all we are, and all we have, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Really, this ſhould work in us great confuſion, that ſuch precious things, and ſuch forcible motives, obliging us to tend to this Abnegation, we arrive at it ſo ſlowly, and moſt men ſo ſeldom. O how few truly annihilated perſons are to be found! few that do not live according to the corrupted life of the old man, producing actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, when ever occaſions of honour, or profit, or pleaſure are preſented: Few that attain to loſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce themſelves in ſuch points as tend to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Let us therefore employ all our forces to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at this happy eſtate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O the ſpirits that are thus dead, what an admirable life do they live I and hereby become rare inſtruments in the hands of God, capable to act great matters tending to his glory: Theſe are intimately united to him, wholly transformed and annihilated in God; and by this gainful loſs, and happy annihilation, arrive t the height of perfection, they enjoy a ſetled peace, a pure and ſolid contentment incomparably ſurpaſſing all ſenſuall pleaſures. Theſe are ſo far advanced above all earthly greatneſs, above that Idol-Honour, which the world ſo much admireth, that theſe are become

                     <p>Of theſe illuſtrious dead men, and moſt divinely annihilated ſouls, the Angel ſpeaks in the Apocalypſe, <hi>Write, bleſſed are they that dye in the Lord from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, for they reſt from their labours.</hi> And indeed this verity ſhould be writ in Letters of Gold, in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Saphyrs and Rubies.

                  <p>During theſe great pains and torments, both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and minde, and during the whole courſe of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his ordinary employment conſiſted in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate elevations of his minde to God, in thoughts
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115611:177"/>and words of bleſſing, praiſe, and ſubmiſſion to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was laid upon him, of meekneſs, and perfect obedience to all that attended, and had the care of of him, with ſuch a humble and contented ſpirit, that he thought all well done, though ſometimes it was otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>He expreſt a wonderful patience, which ever gave a check to any complaint; ſtill ſaying, that he ſuffered nothing, although his pains were extraordinary: And when his keeper; which was a Siſter of the Hoſpital of Charity, with whom he had viſited ſo many poor and ſick ſolks, did importune him to declare his grief, O Siſter (ſaid he) how doth the love of God wipe away all pain? The Servants of God-fuffer nothing. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friend demanding of him, if his pain was not great? He anſwered, No. The other replied, That he thought it was. Its true, ſaith he, that I am much clogged with my diſeaſe; but I feel it not, becauſe I do not think of it. Being urged by their ſiſter to take ſome ſweet things, he refuſed ſaying; Theſe conduce little either for life or death, and are not at all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>Yet he refuſed not Phyſick, though it was very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he took with a chearfull countenance, and ſwallowed it with great difficulty, without leaving any. The day before his death, one told him of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent medicine, which had done great cures. He anſwer'd, Patience is a ſoveraign remedy, intimating his unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to try it; yet when it was brought, he took it without any reluctancy, or once asking what it was, evidencing his myſtical death to any thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him.</p>
                  <p>His ſickneſs encreaſing, and afflicting him very ſore,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115611:177"/>yet he never call'd for any thing to refreſh or relieve him; and when they had forced lean ſheets upon his bed, and a pillow, which he had formerly refuſed with great confuſion and humility; he ſaid, Lo here lies a Gentleman at his eaſe.</p>
                  <p>Feeling ſome natural affection of joy ariſe in him, upon the ſight of a perſon of his acquaintance, with whom he had held a ſtrict correſpondence in ſpiritual matters, who came out of the Countrey of purpoſe to viſit him; he ſtraightway ſuppreſt it, repeating theſe words three times over, with great fervour, <hi>I deſire nothing more but God;</hi> which demonſtrated clearly his perfect diſengagement from all created things.</p>
                  <p>He commended to this parties care the miſſions (entreating him to labour eraneſtly in that buſineſs, as an employment by which God was much glorified, and the moſt profitable to the Church of any he knew) in theſe words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Promiſe me Sir, that you will take pains therein, and promote them with all peſſible diligence: O Sir, it is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice well pleaſing to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reflecting upon the poor (for whom he had always a moſt tender care) he ſaid to his Lady;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I recommend the poor to you, will not you have a great care of them? you will perform it better than I: Fear nothing, what you give to them, will not leſſen the reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt part of the firſt week, and ſome time alſo of the ſecond, that he lay ſick, were ſpent by him in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115611:178"/>works of mercy, appointing ſeveral Alms, and giving or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for letters to be writ into ſeveral Provinces about buſineſſes of Charity; with which he ſtood charged, and whereof he gave an exact account,</p>
                  <p>Many perſons of quality came to viſit him, whom he received with much civility; but not without ſome trouble, by reaſon that moſt of thoſe viſits drew on diſcourſe of worldly things and complements, of which he complained, ſaying,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They come hither to talk their Philoſophy, of which I have no need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And another time his expreſſion was:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Chriſtian ſhould talk little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Lady of great worth and piety, coming to viſit him; ſaid, Sir, I would with all my heart lay down my life to ſave yours. To whom he replied with a chearful look, and his eyes lifted up to heaven;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To dye is not to be loſt, our converſation and union will hereafter be more near and intimate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, Sir, ſaid ſhe, if God would reſtore your health, and continue you longer with us, do not you deſire it? St. <hi>Martin</hi> deſired to live upon theſe terms. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, with much confuſion:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Madam, there is no compariſon betwixt a Saint and a ſinner, the will of God be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:115611:178"/>
                  <p>The third day of his ſickneſs, he deſired, that his Ghoſtly Father might be ſent for: Whereupon they took occaſion to demand of him, if he found himſelf much worſe. He anſwered,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No, but that in a buſineſs of that conſequence, and where the memory and judgement were ſo ſubject to decay, it were not ſafe to defer, for fear of a ſurpriſal; and that it were very fitting to do that, which he had ſo often adviſed others unto, in the ſame condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The day after he made his Confeſſion, and then called for his Reliquary, that he might enter more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly into a communion with all the Saints. The day after, he confeſt again, and almoſt every day till his death.</p>
                  <p>The Paſtor of his Pariſh came to give him the Communion; and obſerving him after receiving, in a great ſilence, not ſpeaking one word, but onely with profound humility; ſaying,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My God, my God, pardon me, I am a great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He asked him the reaſon, why he ſpake ſo little, and did not apply himſelf to thoſe that ſtood by, and were well pleaſed to hear him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is not fitting,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to ſpeak in the preſence of the Word Incarnate, which I have received, nor take up any room in thoſe hearts, which ought not to be filled, onely with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:115611:179"/>
                  <p>But he added beſides;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That his ſpirit was then applied to that joy, which a creature ought to have, to ſee it ſelf upon the point of being re-united to his firſt Principle, and to its laſt end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame day after dinner, one told him it was fit to uſe ſome diverſion from his ſerious thoughts, the Phyſicians judging his diſeaſe to have much of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly in it. To whom he replied, I never had any joy comparable to that I have felt this day. He ask'd him, upon what cauſe? To think, ſaith he, that I am going to be united with my God; repeating the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Cupio diſſolvi &amp; eſſe cum Chriſto; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre to be diſſoved, and be with Chriſt;</hi> and thoſe alſo of the beloved Diſciple, <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come; and let him that heareth ſay, Come; and, he that thirſteth, let him come: Behold, I come quickly, Amen. Come Lord Jeſus:</hi> Yet reſigning himſelf as well for life as death, unto the will of God.</p>
                  <p>One day about noon, he deſired that his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber window might be ſet open, that he might behold the brightneſs of the day; which being done, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O bright day of Eternity! how this Sun-ſhine chears me, helping me to meditate on that day, which ſhall never have night-</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more his ſickneſs and pain encreaſed, the more he ſtrove to unite himſelf to God by prayer, imitating his heavenly Maſter, who in the ſtrength of his Agony
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:115611:179"/>prayed the more earneſtly: And when the violence of his diſeaſe oppreſſed him more, and he had need of greater ſtraining to think upon God, he cryed out:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Courage, courage, Eternity is at hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With many ſuch like ſpeeches, uttered with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible fervour, but which could not be diſtinctly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, by reaſon of the extream dryneſs of his throat, cauſed through the feavour; till at laſt, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his ſpeech all on a ſudden, he fixed his eyes ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly on heaven, for a quarter of an hour together, with a ſmiling look, and full of reverence, as if he ſaw ſome extraordinary ſight: After which muſtering up all his forces, he ſate up in his bed, took off his cap, and holding it in his hand, he ſaid, as it were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed and overwhelmed with this Contemplation, with great ſtraining, and words half ſtifled in his throat, as well by the ardency of his ſpirit, as the weakneſs of his body;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I adore you, I adore you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Curate having adminiſtred to him Extream Unction at the time appointed; which he received with great devotion, anſwering to each prayer, and attending to what he ſaid, and repeating them a good while after. He asked him, if he would give his bleſſing to his children. He anſwered,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How ſo, good Sir, ſhall I preſume to give a bleſſing in your preſence? I ſhould be happy to receive one from you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:115611:180"/>
                  <p>But being urged thereunto, and told that the Church allowed that laudable cuſtom, he lifted his hands and eyes up to heaven; ſaying,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I pray God give it to you, and may it pleaſe him to bleſs you, and to preſerve you, by his grace, from the malignity of the world, that you may have no part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; And above all, my children, that you may live in the fear and love of God, and yield due obedience to your Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On Saturday, which was the day of his death, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an hour paſt ten in the forenoon, being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered out of a violent fit of a Convulſion, which had like to have carried him away, looking attentively on thoſe that were preſent, he made ſigns with his hands, head, and eyes, with a pleaſant countenance, for a perſon of quality, and his intimate friend, to come neer him: Which being done, he ſpake thus to him:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir, I have one word to ſay to you before I dye</hi> (then pauſing a little, to recover his ſtrength, he teſtified his affection to him, but in words that could not diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be underſtood, at length raiſing his voyce, and ſpeaking more articulately and plainly, he proceeded) <hi>The perfection of Chriſtian life, is to be united unto God, in the faith of the Church: We ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle our ſelves in novelties; let us adore his conduct over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and continue faithful to him unto the end; let us adhere to that one God, crucified for our ſalvation; let us unite all our actions, and all that is in us, to his
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:115611:180"/>merits, hoping that if we continue faithful to him, by his grace, we ſhall be partakers of the glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I hope we ſhall there ſee one another one day, which ſhall never have end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The party ready to reply, and give him thanks, Monſieur <hi>Renty</hi> ſtopped his mouth, ſaying,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adieu, this is all I have to ſay to you, Pray for me</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some time after this, and a little before his death, fixing his eyes ſtedfaſtly upon heaven, as if he had diſcovered ſomething extraordinary; he ſaid,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Holy Infant Jeſus, where is he?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thereupon they brought him his Picture, which he kiſſed devoutly; and asking for his Crucifix, took it in his hands, and kiſſed it moſt affectionately. Then turning himſelf towards death, preſently entred into his laſt agony, which held not above a quarter of an hour, of which he ſpent the moſt part in pronouncing the Holy name of Jeſus; making as well as he could acts of Reſignation, and commending his ſpirit to God; after which he expired ſweetly, and his holy ſoul, as we have good cauſe to believe, departed to its place of reſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus lived and dyed Monſieur <hi>de Renty,</hi> one of the moſt glorious lights that God hath beſtowed upon his Church in this age, and one of the greateſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of true devotion that hath appeared this long time. He died at <hi>Paris,</hi> the 27 year of his age, the 24 of <hi>April,</hi> 1649. about noon, neer the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:115611:181"/>time of our Saviours elevation on the Croſs, of which a certain perſon having a particular knowledge in his prayers, applied the merits of this paſſion to him at the inſtant of his death; in ſuch ſort, that this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, together with his own acts of reſignation and annihilation which he had made, and with which he both honoured and embraced the Croſs, are piouſly believed, to have perfectly purged his ſoul, and put it into a condition of entring into its beatitude and enjoyment of God at the inſtant of its diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>There are reports of ſeveral Revelations and Viſions concerning his ſtate of glory, and how at the inſtant of his death, a Globe of light was ſeen aſcending from earth to heaven. Certain mira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I onely adde by way of concluſion, that we have great reaſon to admire the ſecret counſels of God, in taking out of the world a man ſo uſeful; who being in his full ſtrength, and flower of his age, and in ſuch an eminent degree of credit, reputation, and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, might wonderfully have advanced the honour of God, and good of his neighbour.</p>
                  <p>But when I ſay it was the hand of God, all things are therein concluded: And hereby he is pleaſed to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:115611:181"/>let us know, that he hath no need of us for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his glory, &amp; the execution of his deſigns, which he can bring about without us; and when he is pleaſed to make uſe of us his inſtruments therein, we are to behave our ſelves with great humility in his preſence. He hath tranſlated him to another place, where he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies his Majeſtie with greater perfection; to a place and ſtate, that truly deſerves the name of glory, and that not onely in conſideration of what the Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but of what they render to the King of glory. Moreover, we may affirm, that theſe holy men, great pillars of the Church, and comforts of the fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>And truly when firſt I heard the news of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the danger that he was in, I could not but make this reflection that conſidering ſo ſolid and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a vertue, notwithſtanding that great need the world had of him, and the exceeding great good he might ſtill have done in it, it was very likely he might dye, as being a fruit ripe for heaven; even as fruit in its maturity is ready to be gathered, and takes hurt, by being plucked too ſoon or too late. Thus did God gather this good man, in the maturity of his graces, and perfection of his vertues, as a man perfect and compleated, to place him in heaven, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his juſt reward; where he waits for us, to adore, and glorifie, and love, together with him, in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection God the Father, the Son, and H. Ghoſt, to whom be Honour, Praiſe, Benediction, and all ſorts of Adoration and Service, now and for ever. Amen.</p>

               <head type="sub">How we ought to read the Lives of Saints.</head>
               <p>TO conclude this work, and render it more uſeful to the Reader, I think it will not be amiſs, to afford him ſome inſtructions how to read the Lives of Saints, and Hiſtories of perſons eminent in vertue; to the end, that that fruit may be reaped by them, for which they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled. Theſe eminent ſouls then, are to be conſidered two ſeveral ways: 1. As they have relation to God. 2. As to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, as they relate to God, it is certain, that theſe Saints, and Perſons, famous for Piety, are the greateſt Maſter-pieces, the richeſt Ornaments, the moſt precious Jewels, the choiceſt Works, and the greateſt Inſtruments of Gods Glory, that are upon earth. For if the meaneſt righteous man is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more noble and honourable, than all ſinners put together (ſince theſe are the very ſlaves of the Devil, and enemies of God, even the greateſt Kings
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115611:182"/>and Monarchs of the Univerſe (according to the eſtimate that truth it ſelf makes of them) ignoble and infamous, whereas the other is a ſervant, friend, and child of God (whoſe ſervice is perfect freedom) how much more honourable and glorious are the Saints, and the Perſons of ſuch heroick Vertue, becauſe they poſſeſs ſuch juſtice and vertue in a more high degree, have a greater abundance of gifts and graces, partake more fully the perfections of God, are more lively images of him, and enjoy a neerer alliance and reſemblance with our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and are his richeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and his choiceſt workmanſhip.</p>

               <p>Theſe words and conſiderations are applicable to all his Saints, of whom we may ſay, that they are the great
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:115611:183"/>procurers of his honour, and by their Faith, Hope, Charity, Patience, Fortitude, Humility, Obedience, Chaſtity, and other Vertues, like ſo many high-ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trumpets, do make the earth echo with his praiſes.</p>
               <p>We ought therefore to have a high eſteem of all the Saints and perſons of ſignal Vertue, we are obliged to a particular veneration of them, praiſing, and loving, and honouring them, and our Saviour Chriſt in them, and for them; for undoubtedly, <hi>Mirabilis in Sanctis Deus,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaith; God is moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and to be praiſed, loved and feared in his Saints. We ought to admire his power, in their miracles, the might of his grace, in their heroick actions; we ought to hope in his mercy, on the conſideration of thoſe happy changes he wrought in them; and to fear his juſtice, when we conſider thoſe ſevere chaſtiſements, which he inflicted upon their ſmalleſt faults; and love his bounty and goodneſs, in thoſe demonſtrations of his mercy and benignity which he hath ſhewed to them.

So neither on the other ſide, ought we to be too incredulous or raſh to condemn; ſince it is certain, that there ever have been, and ever will be,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:115611:183"/>true miracles; nor is it juſt for us to meaſure the power and goodneſs of God, by our reaſon, nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his bounty by the narrowneſs of our hearts.</p>
               <p>Since the great myſteries of the Incarnation, and of the H. Euchariſt, together with what God hath wrought in the beginning, and continues working every day for man (whereof we can raiſe no doubt) there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can ſeem incredible in the Graces, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of God communicated to a ſoul, ſince nothing herein can be paralell'd with the former. Our Saviour teſtifies greater love to weak man, giving himſelf to him more miraculouſly, and in a more tranſcendent manner in one Communion, than he ever manifeſted to all his Saints, in thoſe extraordinary Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his graces and favours to them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, what bounty, what compaſſion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs did he exerciſe towards men, whilſt he lived amongſt them? What did he not for them, in his life? what did he not ſuffer for them at his Death, after his glorious Reſurrection, when he was in a condition ſo far above them? what familarity and intimacy did he ſhew to his Diſciples, viſiting them frequently, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed in divers ſhapes, appearing viſibly to them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ſeveral meetings with them, talking lovingly with them, ſuffering them to touch him, and eating with them: Theſe familiarities are very wonderful, and withal very certain; we may truly affirm, that the love of God to mankinde, and particularly to pure and innocent ſouls, is unconceiveable, <hi>Cum ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicibus ſermocinat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We muſt not therefore think it ſtrange, if God (who is truly a Father to mankinde, and ſo far tranſcends in paternal affection all others, that in compariſon of him, they deſerve not the name of Fathers) hath ſuch tender bowels, and amorous affections to the Saints, who are his deareſt children; which he expreſſed often with unconceiveable intimacies and careſſes, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will judge of the reality of them, muſt firſt be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the ſame love, that God bears in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal boſom, ſome glimpſe whereof we may conceive, by conſidering the embraces, and kiſſes, and welcomes that paſſed betwixt the Prodigal Son and his Father in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20.</p>
               <p>Here therefore, according to the obſervation of the Ancients, <hi>Ne quid nimus;</hi> let there be nothing done too much, let there be neither too much facility, nor too much difficulty to believe what is ſaid of the graces done by God to holy ſouls: But let us balance our ſelves equally between the one and the other, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and examining things in the ſcales of Divine Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not of Humane Reaſon. And thus much for the firſt conſideration, as they relate to God.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond, as they relate to us, Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the great hath an excellent Note, <hi>Homil.</hi> 34. <hi>in Evang,</hi> where he ſaith, That God hath not lighted
